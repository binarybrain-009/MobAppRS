Repository for Mobile based App Recommender System

The file starts at main.py

**Sample_Extraction.py**

It extracts the positive sample and creates false negative samples for the test set

**Main.py**

->It imports train from train module

->Imports load_data from data_loaders module

**Data_loaders.py**

->load_data- Calls all the functions listed below to return the kg triples and adj matrices

->load_Samples- Loads all the positive negative samples file and calls the dataset_split to divide into train, test and valid

->dataset_split- Split the dataset into train test and valid

->load_kg-Loads the KG and then calls contruct_kg

->construct_kg- Construct the KG triplets dictionary

->Construct_Adj- Construct the adjacency entities and adj relations matrices adj entities has the entity number of the neighbour relations and the adj relation has the relation number of the attached relationship.

**Train.py**

->train-Takes the adj and kg file makes initializes the KGEP model, Calls the topk_Setting, does training in batches, gets the topk_Eval function and prints the precision recall and MAP-N

->topk_setting- Get all samples from train data and only positive samples from the test data,

->get_feed_dict-Getting indices of app_Head and app_Tail and the entities.

->ctrl_eval-It calculates the Precision, Recall and Mean Average Precision

->precision-Calculate precision

->maps-Calculate mean average precision

->topk_eval-Evaluate our data, Calculate test_item_list, Get the user score against different test_item_list. Put it into item_score_map then sort it.

->get_user_record-All samples of training set and positive samples of test set are reserved

**Model.py**

Initializer-Initialize the KGEP objects

Build KGEP objects

-Get neighbours of entities and relations

-Take mean of relationship embeddings

-Aggregate embeddings of the neighbours

-Concatenate the embeddings

-Multiply the head and tail aggregated embeddings then normalize the score using sigmoid

**Aggregator.py**

Boilerplate code for several different Aggregator methods
