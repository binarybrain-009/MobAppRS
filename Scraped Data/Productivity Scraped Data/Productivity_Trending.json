However even though my connection is very well, my pictures and videos never load. No matter how good my internet connection is. And I cannot download them back, it always says something like \"Unable to download\" If I could I would use another cloud app, but I'm unable to do so now, thanks OneDrive","When it uploads from my laptop it's great. When it decides it's not going to upload anymore, it's worthless to me. Not to mention dangerous to the files I need backed up. I followed every instruction I can find to get things to upload without any luck. The last time this happened it just started working again for seemingly no reason at all. Aw, I live for the good old days when you could actually get product support from Microsoft. As it is I need to find another storage solution :/","I've never been one for making an effort to save photographs so going digital was great until I lost all my pics when my phone got damaged. Now I have one drive I have no more problems. every photo saved without having to remember to save. I've made story books, used effects, found photos by time and place. And I can access them on any device any where and send and share. And I feel save having them on one drive. So for me it's fantastic.","Well, it works, I can access my OneDrive. But it sure is a no frills, bargain basement app. No ability to set a uniform default view or a default sorting option across all folders. No option to set folders or documents as favourites for easy access. No option to add a folder or document to the desktop. Basically, the app manages to suck despite the fact it actually works.","I love being able to access my files from anywhere. If you know how to save a file to your computer you can use onedrive. If you have it saved under onedrive on your computer it will be accessible. You can see, and edit your documents right on your app as well. The one thing I don't like is how it saves my pictures. The information it shows is the date when I uploaded it. I want to see when the picture was taken.

I enjoy using it for writing, and local saving of documents is helpful. However, it can be a little janky with loading large files, and the italics button (which I use quite often for my creative writing) on Android is now squirreled away in a hard-to-find, unhelpful location, and was replaced with the checklist button. If not for that small gripe, I'd give five stars.","I gave it five stars, because it has made things easier with my disability. However, voice to text seems to fail me often, which isn't exactly the apps issue. I have experienced multiple moments where the app freezes, and won't let me open until connecting to a Wi-Fi network. That is always a bit odd being as my mobile data is available. Not to mention, a bit annoying. There are no ads, but I have it set up this way through my settings.","It's kind of like Google drive was a while ago. It's a great app but it's buggy. As soon as you've got a bit too many files they start to have problems with snycing. As I scroll down they load and glitch out. Sometimes the files don't even show and I have to look for them in the search bar. Now it's worse than it's ever been, files that should be \"available online\" simply don't open. This didn't use to happen..","This would've been five stars last year, but there are two things that are spoiling my experience. First, when my friend and I update our documents, her updates don't fully load for me unless she opens them a second time. Please fix this. Second, the italics button has been moved from the bottom bar to the much less intuitive top button. These extra steps are unnecessary and annoying. Please put it back where it was.","The offline access problem discussed in the most recent reviews started on 30 June after an update to this app. Prior to that I had no problem accessing offline files. I've reported this bug twice but it still has not been fixed in the latest update today. Very disappointed by Google's lack of response to this bug.

It is super easy to save recipes that I find on line. It is also very easy to edit records. The improvements that I would like to see are 1) Being able to make folders so I can easily find recipes for Holidays, soups, vegetarian dishes, etc. 2) Be able to delete an individual item from the calendar, instead of all or nothing. 3) Be able to add recipes to a calendar where you can see what else is on there for the day.","I've used my Cozi app for several years, and had upgraded to the Gold level for the past 2-3 years.

The layout/design, beautiful themes and many calculators combined in one make it stand out! But the loan calculator seems a bit confusing to me. The 20% of 50,000 should be 10,000, but the calculator said it's 11,074.79. For example, equal total payment for 50,000 @ 20% for 24 weeks should be 60,000 divided by 24 = 2,500 per week, but the calculator said it's 2,544.79. Please is there something I'm missing?","I liked the app on the beginning, however, the number grid and math functions (+,√ó,√∑,=,-,) have since disappeared and has been replace with a top grid of numbers and a side grid of letters (A,B,C,D,E,F) I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get back to original number/function page. So at this point the app sucks big time.","I had a \"unit converterr\", a \"currency calculator\", a \"loan calculator\" and a normal calculator. This app proves that they can all be combined in an intuitive interface, plus some more obscure \"calculations\". Definitely 5 stars. If anything, the possibility to choose where the exchange rates are updated could be introduced... and a few (very few) details I will inform the developer after some more use. Thank you!","I used to like this calculator, now i have changed the smartphone to a Xiaomi redmi note 10S and it seems that the app just doesn't work anymore. I open it and it closes instantly if i tap a key or just after a few seconds if I don't press anything. I've reinstalled it and still doesn't work. I'd like to use this app if an update will fix this. Thanks!","It is a very good app !!!! It meets all my needs as a calculator !!!!!

Most of the apps I have used, you can't highlight or strike through.

It's a word processing program for my phone.","Very handy, my new recipe \"book\". Been using for a couple of year's, with no problem. Easy to make new subcategories, add new recipes. Make \"beef\" category, put beef recipes for beef in it. When some get big and harder to find recipes, put sub categories in like \"steak\", \"roasts\", \"hamburger\". I us it for shopping list's. Reminders, and any list's that I need. Great app. Sync to my phone,laptop, and computer.","I am Lavanya and I am a 5th grader. I installed Microsoft OneNote because I have heard that we can make notebooks in it and there can be different pages in them as well. I thought this app will help me in organizing my notes. And its true. We can not only make notebooks in this app but we can organize our stuff properly as well. Wherever I travel, now I dont have to carry books and notebooks with me study and I can read my notes anytime, anywhere!","I just try it. It's good, sync well between device. But I hope the eraser feature could work just like the pen feature, to only erase the area that is touch by the cursor. Sometimes I need to write with connected letters. The eraser delete a connected drawing, so when I want to correct something, it would erase all of the letters of the word I've been writing.","Very thing was fine. Just a few suggestions for Microsoft team 1. When we sign out of an account the stops opening or the account isn't signed out. 2.Improvement needed in app opening speed. 3.To get the first issue sorted I had delete the app and install it again and sign out once more to add my other account.

The only killer problem is the Arabic language support! Come on guys! you have millions of Arabic users. Show them some love! There's no right to left text orientation (right alignment). Also once you start mixing Arabic and English words, the text goes to the wrong sides. Please fix it! Millions of users will appreciate it. Thanks","In love with the app! While other apps has a system where you kinda have to work with it's rules and limitations, Notion lets do whatever you want and need to have a system that fits your needs. Also, the templates available gives you a good start when you don't know how to structure the project or schedule you have. And the best of all ( which got me surprised , to be honest ) there's no in-app purchases ! For me, it's the perfect app for everything I need to organize .","I use it Notion on the computer and I wanted it on my phone too, but I don't know why it couldn't work.

Its gotten better at connecting and staying connected. Wish I didn't need my phone next to me to enter a password, and the amount of data it sucks up is astronomical!

Have been around so many loops to try and resolve and appears to be no solution. Also, it will intermittently just completely disconnect between phone and computer with no way of coming back and then have to go through a whole process to uninstall on both phone and computer and reconnect. Then invariably whilst doing this it'll get stuck on some page loop trying to reconnect it.","I love the \"intended\" functionality of the app, it's the delivered functionality that loses a couple of stars for me. I use it all the time and have ever since it came out. But it is SO temperamental. Recently, the problem is that text messaging works just fine...as long as the message is to a single recipient. If there are multiple recipients, it will not send. It'll receive messages from multiples, just won't send. Please fix, otherwise I love the app.","This app is mostly pretty nice, it seems to be about the closest equivalent to the Apple ecosystem that you can get with Android/Windows. It is interesting that for some reason if you use a VPN, you have to enable the ability to sync over mobile data, because for some reason the app will think you're on data even if you're actually connected to wifi. Otherwise this app is amazing.","Was working great for quite a while, I used the Share to Phone Companion/PC quite often, as sharing a link from my phone to my PC would place it in my notifications.

No matter what everyone else says, I think this is a brilliant and simple app to use. The text editing bar is easy to use and you have easy access to all your documents! My only issue is that you can't add pictures (at least I don't know how to anyway) so it would be cool if you could add that. I would definately recommend installing this immediately.","I love it really helped me when I'm writing .I use this app a lot when writing (When I don't want to use Google docs) I really love this app .Good appüòåüíï","Works well and is quite convinient.

My only complaint is that it doesn't seem to process line breaks properly, so that tends to be a problem when I'm writing poetry on this app. Also, cloud sync is Pro only, but I wish at least I can make my own backups (non-automatic sync, basically).

Then today, only my 4th day on the app, it has completely stopped working. I logged in and only receive a plain white screen. So sad it didn't pan out to be what I hoped it was.","This app is AMAZING!!! It is so helpful for growing in your faith. You can even start a group with people you know to work on abibke study together! They have a bible study for almost any book of the bible! I cannot recall ever being given an ad either! This app is really amazing and I recommend it to anyone who would like to grow in their faith and look at some AMAZING bible studies!!","I LOVE HOW THEY HAVE LECTURE PODCASTS .

My boss spent a long time on the phone with customer support and still got nowhere. And, after setting up fingerprint lock to log in, then having my phone's fingerprint sensor malfunction, the app did not allow me the option of logging in with my password. Needless to say, we quit using it after a month, and the information on the notes is lost forever. Intuit blows","New QuickBooks GPS tracking is extremely inaccurate & faulty compared to the previous TSheets version. \"Notes\" is a good feature but items written in this section, even after saving, will disappear. Have also had many occasions where Notes that were successfully saved disappeared 3-4 days later. Did not have these issues with TSheets. \"Take a Break\" is inconveniently placed & when accidentally started there is no way to stop it until the 30 minutes are up.","Works pretty well but make sure that you have your notes filled in or it won't clock you out. I wish there was an audible alarm when this happens because it's easy to not notice when you are busy and find out hours later you are still on the clock. also, if I add notes immediately upon signing in they don't always get saved.","I was a Tshhets customer before the sold to Intuit and integrated it into QBO. I used to love this app. Ever since giving it over to Intuit, it is absolutely disfuctional. The mobile. app doesn't even let you log in. The Web app constantly logs you out then mixes up it's log in with QBO. I have to try log in 2-3 times before it goes to tsheets. Yesterday I had to log back in 6 times, essentially everytime I need to log out of a client for break or switch clients, I get kicked all the way out.","hard to share hours if people don't connect properly, should also add in a note function for dates or extra expenses to be shared with an employer so receipts could be added by picture and logged and paid put with ease. also if there was a way to flag days paid ? so it looks cleaner and is clear which dates were being used for a pay period that would make it alot more user friendly. otherwise I really like this app just would love to see

Loud ads KILL this app!!!! It is so annoying to have the alarm go off and then have to wait 5 or 10 seconds through an annoying ad before I can shut that off. It especially sucks if you have someone else in the bed with you who gets up later. Yeah, the wife gets pissed off because it wakes her up completely. \"Sorry honey, just waot for the annoying ad with the jackhammer sound then go back to sleep.\" Yeah right. Silent ads are ok","The add keeps fading in contrast until you can't see anything except a dark screen. It also locks your ability to change the contrast settings. Very strange and frustrating. Will be deleting this app. I will say the ability to set multiple alarms was nice.","Customer service was fast and good to work with. Still a great program. Thanks for all the help. Dean Love the program. I purchased it a while back and all was good until just recently. It now has ads. The problem is I have 3 Google accounts for different emails and it is looking at 1 that I didn't use to purchase it with. If I delete the account it shows paid. If I add it back it has ads. It didn't use to do this. Any help would be great.","very flexible alarm. Different alarms, many different ways to be woken.This is the only alarm that actually works well with Google.

I used to use an alarm clock, which woke me, but I'd half-sleepily turn it off before I was fully concious.

If you're the person that can't get up in the morning this app is for you. You can set time for the alarm, days of the week, the music for the alarm and the best part challenges for the alarm. You can add a challenge to take a picture of something, solve a math problem, shape sequence (simon says), memory, smile to selfie, retype words, and make a pose. But the only bad thing i have is the ads. They pop up every time you save.","It was great, the picture challenge helped me a lot as someone who struggles with hitting snooze a million times. Having said that, he ads have gotten out of control. Unskippable 5s ads, I close one and another one shows up, some of the ads have fake X's in the top corner. On top of that the ads show up seemingly every 2 or 3 clicks. To the point it ended up taking me 10 minutes to set 1 new alarm with a custom sound... So frustrating. I'm looking for a new alarm app for sure","I am not a morning person, usually my mother spends alot of time to wake me up. Believe it or not this app can wake me up easily. With the traditional phone alarms I can easily disable them. But for this one I have to get up to solve questions or go outside to take a picture, else it just won't stop!!!!. While going through this motion I am fully awake.üòÖ","Really awesome app, works as described. Only issue is even if you pay to remove adds the app occasionally glitches out and forgets you did this and displays pop up ads with timers and ad banners at the bottom of the screen...

A common problem I have is a task has a specific time and duration, but sometimes I don't get around to it at the exact time so I would like it to only be completed when I actually manually mark it off.","you speak your list of errands, schedule, set alarms, connect an app for messaging your tasks at hand, sets up your calendar, reminds you on time, and it is a very easy application to use...especially settings for different types of notifications, you can customize notification sounds according to topic of interest also. highly reccomend","The user interface is horrible. The way the tasks show up is very difficult to see and read at a glance, and the font in most places is so small it's not even readable. There are only five predefined color schemes for themes, none of them are at all attractive or easy to read. I set a reminder, and it didn't even go off. For an app this expensive, I would expect much more. There are a ton of free apps that are so much better than this one.","Anydo is great, but... - 1star for no account free option. I value privacy more than cross-platform. - 1 star for upgrade requiring yearly payments. I understand that $3/mo doesn't seem like much to developers, but for people who have many apps and limited funds, subscriptionware adds up. (And we don't hit a coffee shop more than a couple times a year, so swallow the urge to make that comparison) Anydo is simple to use and has a clean, clear interface. Too bad there's no simple upgrade.","Almost. As in good integration with other apps and intuitive. But, the deal breaker for me as mentioned by others was the nagging to get you to upgrade to premium subscription. Yaaa, No! Uninstalled. To the developers.

Also, often it takes a day or more to receive any email and you can't even print or change the priority of the message, terrible! What happened Microsoft? Do something about it! Other than these issues, works like a desktop version. Unfortunately, no better app is available to download. Meh üòí","I have been using Outlook for around 20 years and while it has gone through many changes I find it current incarnation to be satisfying and easy to use. It provides everything needed to manage emails without confusing extras. My one gripe is how hard it is to do multiple deletion of emails as I can only select a few emails together making the process time consuming. Apart from that Outlook is Outstanding!","When you have a fresh install, it will use your default browser. HOWEVER, after a certain amount of time, with all updates and WiFi turned OFF, the \"use default browser\" option will mysteriously appear in settings and will be greyed out and forced to use this app's internal browser. (What is it? A timed setting in the code!?!)","Horribly buggy. Can't delete all messages -- after you do, they all come right back. Another one: recently, my 'other' messages disappeared for no reason, and when I click 'load more messages' nothing happens. Another: sometimes, one of my accounts won't work, but there's no notification saying it's not working, so you can miss important messages. There are more bugs too. The only good thing about this app is the nice uncluttered design. A pity, because I really wanted to like it.","I have loved Microsoft Outlook on my Android app until recently.

I just use 3 layouts for writing stuff down and there's like 15 unique layouts. You can save your papers anywhere you prefer and it has auto save by default. Bold, underline, italic, color, emotes and a bunch of other stuff I don't use. Thats what makes products special, having everything plus more. I don't have microsoft word on computer, always had to use colorless text documents. Love this!","Easy to use and navigate, with a clean, uncluttered look. I like being able to change the layout from Print view to Mobile view, it's very helpful if you're on the move. I don't like having to convert a pdf to a docx file, then make a copy to edit. This is an extremely irritating feature. Surely the original pdf could be opened as a docx file, if that's what users want? Just a simple question when a user is opening a pdf. \"Would you like to open and edit your pdf √¨n docx format\" would be good.","The only issues that i have with this is that a underline appears seemingly randomly every page or so. Though it isn't recognized as an underline, and when I highlight it, underline it, then get rid of the manual underline, the automatic underline is still there. When I erase it, and the entire sentence, and retype it, it is still in the exact location. No spelling or grammar correction needed, but for some reason it will not go away, other than that no issues","Very useful for reading PDF files on my phone, and any other related files. Don't use it for creating documents - prefer to use Word on our main desktop computer, or perhaps on my tablet with a Bluetooth keyboard (purely personal preference). Very easy to use. Started using to create a simple check list - not bad really. Always easy to use to read documents, both Word and PDF.","The icon to switch to the dictate keyboard is always in the way. It really makes an otherwise pretty good experience VERY annoying. I never use that icon. I want to be able to turn it off or even move it away from the exact place where the text I'm typing is showing up as I type it.

Allows you to track what you need to do in a day quite easily. Would definely recomend for routine building.

Adding to this, something to tell you if you've completed all habits in a category. 2) A hexadecimal system for choosing the colours on habits. So you don't have to eyeball custom colour.","Love it üôÇ! I tried out tons of habit apps but this was the best. The more affordable one-time fee was a big reason, but it also met all my needs and I like using it. Categories are a must. I haven't used the rewards part yet, but that is an extra many other apps don't have. I also love that it has dark mode, I can disable all notifications, and it doesn't make sounds.","I would give 4.5 Stars actually for such a Great, useful app. On a smaller aspect The reward section needs to be more consider.

I had to create storage elements as \"rooms\", to have the items in them.

This app has no adjustable \"alternate key adjustment setting\". I find that holding down a key to activate the alternate function of that key requires too long of a delay and breaks the cadence of my writing. This results in a loss of productivity and efficiency. 2. You can not use a long press on the spacebar to move the cursor. Instead a long press changes the input method.","Overall, okay. Its emoji support is really poor. It does fix your Grammar, but it doesn't learn when it ignores grammar rules like changing \"I'll\" to \"I'll\" or \"i\" to \"I\". I wanted to try the premium, but there was no free trial, and the one month trial was $30! I'll just go back to GBoard. Downloaded again, to give it try, and there's still no full emoji support. This can't be too difficult to support.","This is the best grammar and word correction app in the world! The only problem is the lack of a delete button. I can fix it ignore.

Please create simple delete button. I'll totally pay for it. Thanks guys, you're all awesome.","I have mixed feelings about this app which I have had for 2 years. It is extremely helpful with appropriate grammar and clarity. It also will suggest optional ways to rephrase your words. However, it does require a learning curve and does not conform to basic standard Microsoft functions such as cut and paste. I have lost important work in the effort to learn this app. I will probably continue to use it unless google or Microsoft develop something similar.","I noticed that the app takes quite the memory when being used for too long. As someone who makes stories and needs to use it continuously, I find it difficult to type when the keyboard starts lagging and I have to force stop it to prevent it from lagging so much. It also gives out the wrong results when it corrects a word and it even duplicates the word or characters it is trying to correct. It also doesn't detect errors in a sentence sometimes. I hope you can fix this."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.grammarly.android.keyboard","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grammarly.android.keyboard&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Recover Deleted Messages : UnDelete messages","description":"A Must have UnDelete messages: View Deleted Messages app, and all social messengers, that will save you from worst scenarios.\r\n\r\n View Deleted Messages : Recover Deleted Messages and Undelete deleted messages is here to help you out from any messy situation.

How do I manage my stock the way it is possible in the old version? - Price: the old version costs a one time $7.99 (but premium features don't work). This one is at best $44.88 per year!!

And that's it. Impressed for a first launch. Excited to see what's coming up.","Free unlimited storage for 10$/year is a great deal. I would like to see an option to select only certain folders or just videos or just pictures, not jut to Backup everything. Aside from that the app works shamelessly and has good upload speed. Not many options, but it is a backup tool.","Cant upload photos using desktop and cant upload selective folders. This is a downside for this plan being so cheap. Its a total steal deal if you only use your phone to upload photos. Also Please enable users to upload photos using desktop.","This is seriously some next level stuff. If I would've known that it has unlimited storage capacity at rates much lower than other apps, I would've used it sooner and saved so much money.","Hey guys, Idrive Photos is not automatically backing up new photos instantly. I presume it has got to do with the app not always running in the background.

In Android 7 it doesn't support autofill in applications and other webview based browsers. And there is no \"add new\" option in autofill window.","I have used this app for a while now. It is great as I can use on several devices (PC, android phone and Chromebook) and simply share the passwords in a simple and easy way. Works very well - really happy.","Needs to auto sync with cloud. I thought it was doing that until my phone needed to be reset to replace a faulty battery. After restoring my phone, I learned that a bunch of passwords were gone. Nowadays everything has auto back up, but I guess with this you have to remember to back up regularly. To top it all off, just tried to export CSV file using pixelbook and it says I need a desktop app to do that. This app was great at one point, but there are better options.","This app has vastly improved in Android. On Windows 10 the entry/edit window doesn't stay open long enough for me to add stuff, but I have no problem on Android. I need a password/data vault app that I can use on multiple platforms reliably, so I look forward to testing it out when I switch to iPhone & iPad. Have to use it on Mac, yet. Won't import passwords from any browser (though it advertises that it will), and I did follow the instructions. So, hand importing via copy & paste from Lockrz.","Really pleased with this app. Having tried another password manager that drove me to distraction trying to auto fill passwords it didn't know, I tentatively tried this app instead and have been pleasantly surprised. It is simple to use, creates passwords for you if you want (a feature I particularly wanted), and isn't invasive.

It's fast, user friendly, and if ever I do have a problem connecting to the printer/wifi/wifi direct, it fixes itself quickly or I am able to manually fix it quickly with the app. I know a lot of this comes from the app having been around for so long and devs being able to work out all of the kinks over the years, but it shows that they really put in the effort to making it work properly. I do wish I could set B&W to default though.","This app after updating acts as though I have never used it and wants me to start from scratch. It says my printer is unavailable. I'm giving it 1 star now. I had to download another HP app to print so I'm guessing that this app no longer works at all. Below was my last rating with 5 stars. Prints great from all of my devices. I couldn't be happier.","This is not good. Constantly need to reinstall the app each time I want to print, which is crackers. Once reinstalled it works okay, but the interface is not clear, many settings are hard to find (such as duplexing/two-sided printing options) and reconnecting to a network is convoluted; on two ocassions, it has meant yet another uninstall and reinstall process, then adding the printer as a new printer again. Why?","I love everything about it! Easy and user friendly even if not experienced with printing and copying. Lots of online help when needed. I love the convenience of having cartridges delivered to my home always knowing I have enough. Love the option they give to send back free empty cartridges to reduce waste. I have been using this service for about a year now and I just don't know why I didn't know about it earlier! Thank you HP for making printing and scanning so easy and affordable!","2* Slow and frustrating. Very slow to connect and load. If I didn't need this to do my job, I wouldn't even give it a second try. This was my old review. 2021 and this is now such a delight to have. It is instant and works every time. We sail southern California full time and evey time we need to print documents or our cruising friends need to print documents, this little printer comes to the party.

So fix this our lose your customers. I will be first in line.","It works but there is an annoying bug. Every time after a phone call, it tends to mess with my music/video audio. For example, after the phone call, all of the audio plays from my phone speaker that is only used for phone calls. Same with my car audio, it thinks I am in a phone call. The only way to fix it is by closing the app from my multi-task viewer. Hope you can fix it soon because it is annoying.","Terrible!! Awful!! Horrendous! Don't get this app!!

Recently, the 'pre-view' page is very slow to load and when it does load only a small portion of the document appears before it either goes back to the file page or the app stops.","I'm extremely unimpressed by Dropbox. It begins by desiring access to things it shouldn't need, with no way of letting you deny it if you need the app. Then it gives you a small amount of space for free, too small for the one thing I needed to download. WORST OF ALL: I can't even see how to delete my account. It only let's me log out. I'd give it a lower rating if I was allowed.","Really disappointed with dropbox. i have used the app on my phone for years, unfortunately my phone was lost was lost whilst being abroad. i am desperately trying to log into Dropbox on my laptop to get access to my files, this includes travel documents to enable me to travel home. i have logged a ticket for support and tried to contact the dropbox team on twitter also-getting nowhere and need help urgently!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.dropbox.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dropbox.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"ShowingTime","description":"ShowingTime provides residential real estate agents, offices, associations and MLSs with tools to manage showings and feedback, plus analytics and reporting tools to gain valuable market insights.

I've reinstall the app and replaced phones with no success. This has become a massive concern as it' a major tool in our region to show houses. I expect it to be replaced if things don't get addressed. I'm questioning if it's primarily an Android issue (Note 20).

So every time I open the app I have to skip Location, because I do not need or want the location \"tracking\". It would be nice if there was an option in our settings to not use the Location feature. Is there a way that we can permanently opt out of this instead of having to go through this every time we open the app?","Doesn't work anymore. When I login it just turns blue and nothing happens.

It's meant to mislead people. You sign up, they have your personal info to sale. They'll take the funds they claim they're holding. Legitimate companies that aren't running a scam don't put a hold on your card during the free trial. It's boarder line false advertising. They don't take the funds immediately, but you don't have access to those funds either because they're \"holding\" them. DON'T FALL FOR IT!","Absolutely stay away from this company. Free trial is a scam. They won't let you cancel until you pay them a fee. It's a joke. You can not get a real person to speak to, they hide behind the layers of internet. I never once logged onto their system, never used a single function, and canceled 3 days after sign up for free trial. They won't let me cancel until I pay an erroneous $29 for nothing.

I get 10 points just for unlocking my phone. Sure, it gets annoying that this app sometimes just wakes up my phone to advertise, but the 10 points add up really fast every day. This is great for a disposal phone just to have fun on if you use it every day. It basically pays itself off.","This was so easy. First you get points just for having the S'more page as your own Home page. Then you get points for playing games from a very good selection that they allow you to choose from. Different games give you different points per min or five mine etc. i I was able to win a Walmart gift card in practically no time at all.","I didn't think it would work but so far I've received 600 points and redeemed for $6 (from Amazon) Great app.... recommended to my friends! I just wish there were more ways to earn points. It takes a while.üòä","Not a bad app just puts ads on your homepage. I got a target gift card after about after 3 or 4 months so not bad doing nothing as long as you have it open everyday. Or on top of your notifications bar. Update: reevaluated and gave it 5 stars. No other app has been functioning and real like this one, that I've had for around 2 years. Although the choices are few I love it.","I'm using this app for more than a year now and I:m happy using it. It is a great app that rewards you. You get point just for having it installet on ur phone. And when you need to reedem points, you get them in seconds.

If you like Easy Voice Recorder, please take the time to leave us a nice review; this really helps us out!","comments":["This is one of the absolute best apps I have ever downloaded. Whenever I have a thought or want to record something for posterity this does the trick. Sound quality is exceptional. The process to record and save is so simple and it keeps a record of each recording by date. Is easy to retrieve each recording and listen back to it along with the option of saving again or deleting. It's so nice to have an app that is effective and simple but so valuable. 10 stars.","Great app! Nearly everything about this app is perfect. Not taking anything away, its just that I have not yet learned all. Even the page that pops up and asks for a rating is very pleasant which willingly carried me here.. This should be the app that comes with android. Nice work!","I'm a journalist, and this is the only recording app thus far that doesn't spontaneously delete my recordings. Saves audio automatically, and tells you how much recordable time you have left, which is a huge plus especially when I have a long event. Plus, it's free and ads don't play as soon as you stop recording. Love this app, I've recommended it to everyone I work with. Great job.","I've recently picked up my guitar, again, after a stroke a few years ago. I'm struggling (well, it feels like a struggle to me...) to find my singing voice again. Recording as I practice lets me see/hear that it's going better than I thought! The app is easy to use, which is important. Lets me concentrate on what I'm doing, rather than on figuring out how to opperate and record. Really glad I blundered into it!","I haven't listened to all of my possible legal recordings yet, but I have tested things prior, and everything seemed good. Free and very handy when in sticky situations. 1+ months in using this app, so far so good. A minor few glitches when recording, but phone notification dings when there's an issue, not a big deal as long as you hear the notification and restart the recording. Easy to backup with phone cable to computer (just copy/cut and paste)! 12:55am July 25, 2021."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.coffeebeanventures.easyvoicerecorder","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coffeebeanventures.easyvoicerecorder&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Google Sheets","description":"Create, edit, and collaborate on spreadsheets from your Android phone or tablet with the Google Sheets app. With Sheets, you can:\r\n\r\n- Create new spreadsheets or edit existing files\r\n- Share spreadsheets and collaborate in the same spreadsheet at the same time.\r\n- Work anywhere, anytime - even offline\r\n- Add and respond to comments\r\n- Format cells, enter or sort data, view charts, insert formulas, use find/replace, and more\r\n- Never worry about losing your work ‚Äì everything is saved automatically as you type\r\n- Quickly get insights, insert charts, and apply formatting with smart suggestions\r\n- Open, edit, and save Excel files.\r\n\r\nGoogle Sheets is part of Google Workspace: where teams of any size can chat, create, and collaborate.\r\n\r\nGoogle Workspace subscribers have access to additional Google Sheets features, including:\r\n- Easily add collaborators to projects, see changes as they occur, receive notifications for edits that happen while you‚Äôre away, and chat with colleagues in the same spreadsheet.

Basically everything. I've tested few similar apps and so far this one is the best. One feature I would love to have: option to add some background noise during the focus session. It can be traditional kitchen timer sound, nature sounds etc. It would make the app (for me) even greater.","This app is very visually pleasing but the image on screen that looks like a clock actually isn't a clock and just spins around at random speeds. I'm a very visual person and need an app that will show me a visual representation of what time is left. Honestly don't understand what the point of the clock-esque image is, if anything it's distracting because it wonder what it's purpose is. Also very basic app, no settings. There are much better pomodoro apps out there.","I really like the app except one feature. It makes the device vibrate and play sound once the timer is finished ( you can disable the sound, not the vibration ). If the Dev's make it so that you can disable the vibration this will be the perfect pomodoro timer.","the app performance is over-all good. I hope there would be option to add some personalized notes to each pomodoro session and if the breaktime starts automatically that would be more helpful.","The app is great. It is simple and effective. But there are 2 things, the data can be more specific (hours instead of %) and In the graph, the name of the pomos should be shown. It would also be helpful if we were allowed to switch between pomos and had an overall pomo count instead of individual. But it is a great app with lots of potential.

It's comparison feature is a plus to this app as it make me realise that I am wasting my time more than average people on internet on some apps that I can use in other things. It hepls me improve my productivity but I think if there will be a feature of setting particular time slots for using apps than it will help me more. Overall I like this a lot.","This app is really useful, and it controls me in the use of some apps, like Facebook or YouTube. It makes it easier because of there are no ads in there. Thank you for the developer of this app, to use my phone for a short amount of time, and I'm already aware of how much time I use my phone when I downloaded and used this app.","Is this app has no ads? A bit suspicious tho. But the app runs pretty well and pretty easy to use, similar to Digital Wellbeing on my Samsung phone that also has time limit and even a twist of Homer GIF when the timer runs out. There is a good chance that your app usage is the data they are going to sell to substitute of paying with ads and I don't really mind about it. 5 stars.","I've found that when the display of the apps and the amount of time you used it is on \"Grid\" List Style, it tends to cause a bit of lag or slowness to show the app icon, the name of the app, and the time usage. This also happens when it's on \"Linear\" List Style mode, albeit a bit quicker, but it is still slow nevertheless. Please fix this bug. Thanks!","It really helps keep everything in check and order. It provide factual information about your usage and so on. The limits for the day are really useful. Ir would be better if you can choose to just do it in certain days though. Like have it less strict on a weekend and more strict on a weekday.

Go subscribe to literally any other VPN service that isn't VirtualShield.","So far the only problem I had was when I installed Avast adblocker, which hijacked my PC security and shut Virtualshield off.

So easy to use and understand. I had previously requested they add a SEARCH field, as I have many passwords. They added it with their last upgrade. Very easy to use and a time saver. I have recommended this program to several people, who are just as pleased as I am. THANK YOU!!","Cracking app. Does exactly what you need it to do, which surprisingly enough is to remember all your passwords!! Comes with an easy to use password generator which can be altered to be as long/short/ complicated as you need. Also for good measure you can add credit card details, bank account numbers, secure contact details and notes. Free version was handy if I remember correctly, but I paid for the full version and have never been disappointed. Top recommendation from me, buy it now!!","This app is a life saver. Reasonably priced, easy to use. The only change I would suggest is easier scrolling through the saved passwords.","Be careful these people will bill you automatically even if you don't sign up.. today I just got a notification I am still under free but they billed my account for $12.

Its a very well designed app. A few things, as a user and a fellow developer, I would like to suggest. From a user PoV, the Old UI was much better than the new one. And the character images have been distorted so you should look into those. Other than these, you could add a feature where we can track progress of our characters. Like what level they are, what level their talents are, what constellation they are on, what weapon is their and all. Cheers!","Gives me general information I'm looking for (mats for weapons & characters, what mats can be farmed on a day, and a calculator that gives a general idea on how much resources I need to upgrade something). The only pet peeve I have with the app is that making personal lists is a bit bothersome. If you wanted to make a list of weapons you have, it would require you to apply filters each and every time you would search for a weapon you have.

I asked a couple of their representatives, but they lack so much, its really funny, but that can be ignored. the disappointment was they made me do something which made me loose my work and time just because of them","Broken promises. Says it backs up everything. Had my phone brick itself from an update last night and once I got it working again I had to restore it from a backup as it had been factory reset. Android said there was a backup from 13 hours ago but it doesn't seem to have done anything. No messages, no wallpaper and no apps. Only the basic android cloud app list re download. Don't know why I pay them for a backup that doesn't work.","I've always loved using Google, throughout every aspect of the services they offer/provide.

You are going to get better rates direct from the hotel. So what are we paying for? You tell me.

Also getting connected to the network so you could actually look things up. I lost a lot of my photos if you don't know exactly if they went in albums or not.

From my point of view it does what it says on the tin so to speak, but each to there own personal experiences and opinions, I'm happy to give it 5‚≠ês and aüëçs up","Been using well over 10yrs only one problem can't complain about that, update my cleaner I got with my subscription no longer works after they came out the avg cleaner with adds. This means they ripped me off. By not giving what I paid for. Very disappointed with new owners. Don't waist your money. They are no longer reputable. So sorry another great company gone bad.","I hate to say iy. This was the last chance for this cleaner. I no longer recommend getting this cleaner. It works to the point of placing ads on your phone that you can not clear unless you turn off your phone and restart the phone.. I was using the free app but with this problem. I do not recommend paying for it eather. I am removing this app for good.","My experience both today and a good 95% of the previous times and indeed still now in the present, this very enjoyable app has & given me & I'm very sure it will continue to give me the same level of enjoyment for the foreseeable future, natureably I recommend this excellent security app to everyone if it is indeed the best security you are looking for ok. Do your best & prove me WRONG!!. This app deserves 10 gold stars.","great app that works to help keep your device clean and running smoothly.I have this app on all my devices n it is free and there are very little ads to deal with. would recommend anyone else download as well n use regularly. Update: I have recently bought the yearly subscription for the premium cleaning app and will be informing you of any and all concerns, problems, or good things about the app once I try it out. It was only $11.99 per year n that's for the cleaner app only.

Constant freezing/ crashing on start up and when it doesn't freeze or crash its functions don't work properly 90% of the time. I'd have better luck beating my router with a coat hanger trying to edit its settings than using this app. Just log into the router manually and save yourself the headache of troubleshooting this garbage.","Every time I log into my router to change settings it tells me I can do what I'm trying to do better/faster via this app. That is simply not true. The app takes longer to load than logging in via browser and it is still missing almost every single advanced feature. It also doesn't actually show all the devices on the network. I've set up the wifi room tests multiple times as well but it never saves the information or past results making that feature useless as well.","It needs a traffic meter for each device, not just overall. I downloaded the app because I wanted to start measuring the traffic of a specific device, but it only monitors you overall traffic among all you devices. Plus, as soon as I opened the app, it locked my router. Nothing was seeing the wifi signal anymore. I had to reset my router for anything to see the signal. Then the app kept saying connected to internet, but kept giving me an error code. Had to direct connect with PC to fix it.","Absolutely garbage app. Requires email and password to login to router even though web admin uses username and password. Won't connect through LAN, has to use \"connect anywhere\" to go out to the Internet and back in using remote access. App won't let you rename the satellites. \"Router not found\" when you're perfectly able connected to your router's wifi and surfing the Internet.","this thing kicks whatever devices off for no reason. it could be in the middle of a movie or a wifi call. it just boots me right off. now my router will only display 5 devices which 3 of them are not even in the same state as me anymore and won't refresh. yes I rebooted the router, yes the modem yes the devices themselves. worst router I ever had to deal with."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.netgear.netgearup","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netgear.netgearup&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Smart Home Manager","description":"Check out the incredible new version of Smart Home Manager! \r\n\r\nAT&T‚Äôs Smart Home Manager gives you more ways than ever to personalize and manage your home network.

It works well and is easy to operate. It's easy to schedule an alarm, alter that time, add additional alarms, alter the snooze time and vary methods to turn off the alarm. A scheduled alarm can be turned off (say for a particular day) and can simply be turned on again with just one tap. My only CRITICISM is the sound choices for the alarm. I'd like a nice soothing alarm, non jarring option & easier to add different ringtones.","Great, simple, dependable alarm. As long as this alarm doesn't change, I see no reason to ever try another. Yes it's basic, but that's what so many people want. Easy to programme and reliable - unlike so many other alarms that start of well but don't their performance deteriorates over time. Would be nice to have the option to customize, but no great loss really. The only thing that would make me uninstall would be if there were an increase in ads. Thankfully, it's ok at the moment. Thanks üëç","I like this alarm but there are times where it inexplicably doesn't work. It's easy to set, and easy to add new alarms, easy to delete alarms. You can easily choose what you want to have as your wake-up sound and how long you want it to play. It has been helpful but there have been mornings when I thought I slept through the alarm and the case was that the alarm didn't go off. This morning I was awake before the alarm went off, and so was able to watch as it gave me precisely one second of music/alarm, then the tablet went to the lock screen, no more alarm. I have it set to play for five minutes...correction: I HAD it set to play for five minutes. This morning I checked the settings and it says one minute; and it only played for one second. I have no idea why it changed from five to one minute or why it only played for one second and then the tablet went to the lock screen. For that reason the app gets three stars. It's not reliable. When it works it's great. But when it doesn't it could really screw up your day.","Easy to use, but downloaded different alarm sounds, not crazy about the default \"old timey\" alarm clock sound. Would be cool if more alarm sounds were provided. I found some really great sounds on Zedge. The graduated alarm sound level is helpful. The option to choose up to 3 stop buttons is a great idea for those who need that extra wake up incentive. I prefer the one button stop!! Thanks this is my first experience with this app. Will revisit the rating after I've used it a little longer. üôÉ","It doesn't always operate the same way. Sometimes the buttons appear over my unlock code, sometimes I have to unlock first. Sometimes i can snooze with the power button, sometimes it doesn't work. Wish it would operate consistently."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"ar.com.basejuegos.simplealarm","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ar.com.basejuegos.simplealarm&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Smart Share: Transfer Files, Music, Video, Photo","description":"Share & fast transfer app is a file share and photo finder which is an all in one file sharing app. This smart share could be called as a phone cleaner which simply clears out all the unnecessary and junk files from your phone and free storage and make some extra space.

Happily purchased the pro version to support good app development.","Overall its pretty decent. The manual sorting issue is a real problem, it should be a basic function! Most apps like this you just long press and then drag and drop them into whatever order you want. The widget is decent, not the most aesthetically pleasing. However it does the job overall, and the good thing is it seems to be being updated! :)","It is simple and effective which is what I'm looking for but it lacks such a simple feature to help me organize my tasks and habits, manual sorting. I don't know why I can just drag and drop my habits in the order I want. It sounds small but it's a deal breaker for me. I have habits that I execute in the morning and some in the evening and I want to be and to group them accordingly. EDIT in response to developer: I found those options and tried them all. I couldn't get the sorting I wanted with them. If you add manual sorting as a feature in the near future that would absolutely solve this issue and make me a happy camper. Thank you for the quick reply.","This is one of my favourite and most used apps. The new UI was a bit of a shock at first but I'm quickly getting used to it. It's still clear, simple and easy to use and looks really nice. I have one problem now that I did not have before: the font is way too small. I have to increase it drastically in my phone's settings - and then, of course, it's huge in pretty much every other app. That makes HabitNow hard to use for me. Please make the font bigger again or offer in-app font size options.","Good app but some features are missing. Specifically the ability to have a counter option for habits (do this thing x amount of times per day) also the ability to order your list of daily habits with a user friendly 3 horizontal bar slider.

Secondly, it is simple to use. I don't need an elaborate app just to make short reminder notes. However, I was wondering if it is possible to underline, bold or even cross out the text in my notes. For example, when I have bought something on my shopping list, I might like to cross out the item on my list.","Top shelf app. Easy to use, nice to have access to this product. I have trouble moving all the info from one appliance to another. Any help would be appreciated. It should be simple, I can't seem to get my head around it. Thank you","This is a great app... I have used it for years now. I only suggest that you add a go to bottom of notepad button... I make very long notes and I feel like scrolling down to the bottom taking 30-45 seconds is excessive. Edit: OMG. Thank you to the developer!","Overall, an excellent little app. 1. Like Jenny Williams before, I'd like the app to open in Categories view instead of seeing every note in a long list. 2. The backup exports to a zip file which can only be read by the app. How about an option to back up all notes to a text file, as is possible with individual notes. 3. Change font size would be a good option.","Really like this app's features! Not bloated with ads, not overwhelming with options but still features many useful ones. I like being able to import txt files from my device and export them when I'm done. This app keeps a separate copy in case one of them is lost. It also now includes a read mode so I can review a note without accidentally modifying it.

You can set your own custom amount of reminders I the settings and all new tasks will automatically have those reminders. I like checking them off. Once they're checked off, they're still on a list below that you can find and reactivate. You can create subtasks. I would like to be able to set reminders hourly, however, for things like taking medicine or drinking water.","I *really* want to love this app and make it a part of my daily productivity. The integration with Google Calendar and the ability to create tasks from an email (in Gmail) are game changers for me, however there are two deal breakers: [1] There is no integration with the Google Assistant. This is a surprising oversight given that you can add everything else with your voice (Calendar Events, Reminders, Notes, etc). I have too many use cases where I need to add Tasks with my voice from either my phone, Google Home, or Android Auto. [2] There is no ability to share task lists with other Google users*. I need to share lists with my household (grocery lists, chores, house projects, etc). *Yes, I know there are services that will do this for you but it should be a native feature.","Pretty good. The link with Google Calendar is great, as is the ability to create different categories of task and to set different dates and times for subtasks. Two things that would make this nearly perfect in my view: (1) A separate standalone app for pc use, since the sidebar thing is extra clicks to get to and a computer screen is better for seeing the whole picture at once, and (2) the ability to set different colours to appear on the calendar (perhaps for different categories of task).","Google tasks is the ultimate app that is a necessity to the Google workspace. I give Google tasks a 5 star rating due to the fact all highlighted points stated that the application would accomplish for the user. Personally I downloaded the app to be a type of therapy to my procrastination and it has really helped me with big tasks being able to be broken down into subtasks etc. Highly recommend for your workspace whether it is just a reminder or a large task. üíúüåπ Stay safe y'all!","At last, a simple app! For all those that say it's too simple, and not enough colours, I say, go get a piece of paper, a pen, some coloured pencils and a fridge magnet. It's a fantastic basic job list for crying out loud.

So far, none of the glitches I experienced with the others and some great functions as well. I have multiple email accounts so the colour codings function is really useful. Very happy and relieved I've finally found what appeares to be a user friendly and reliable email app. Thank you.","Nice enough app but with little annoyances... For example, emails with diary invite attachments. The app won't let you save to the phone's calendar, only to reply but then it says 'failed to send'. Also very very slow to update. I have to force it to refresh when I've deleted emails on my tablet, otherwise it will keep the undeleted emails in the inbox indefinitely.","It was working fantastic. Much better than nail app that came with phone... Until yesterday. All mail was gone. I updated the app and now everytime i go to check mail, it says I'm offline and have to put a password in again. This update was to fix AOL sign in, but I was not having that problem until I updated. Now it wont stay signed in to AOL.","Awesome, absolutely a breeze to use. I have multiple email accounts and need different settings for each one, which I can easily do through this app. I have no complaints at all after several months of using it now. There's small glitches that can happen here and there but due to the app being so good, u truly overlook the small little glitches!!!!","This is a nice email app, my favorite in fact, but it has one flaw that I've noticed. When using a VPN connection, a sent email is reported as successfully sent, but the email is not sent and will later be found in the Outbox. This has caused me problems and financial loss a few times. There should really be a 'failed' message if the email fails to send, regardless of the cause. Because of this flaw, I can no longer trust this as my primary email app."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.easilydo.mail","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easilydo.mail&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Stack: PDF Scanner by Google Area 120","description":"Get rid of paper clutter with Stack.

I hope someday this can be used for official government ID. one little thing I just had trouble with is that it doesn't seem intuitive to move things between stacks. I added a document and it was in no stacks. I couldn't add it to one without downloading the PDF and sharing it to the app again, even though it already has a copy of it. minor thing but worth pointing out. I will still use this app heavily. I want to get copies of all my important documents in here.","I love everything Google; it's sync/accessibility/etc is a lifesaver. I would love a scanner app that also doubles as an organizer. While this app is off to a good start in that direction, it's still lacking features that prevent me from fully commiting to using it at the moment. The concept of organizing scanned items into folders is a huge asset for this app! However, the app NEEDS to allow the user to be able to sort said items by name/date. The sooner this function arrives, the better!!","I love this app. I'm documenting all of my purchases, with pics of serial numbers and receipts. They save in Google Drive as a PDF as well, so don't have to only use the app to view it. Google, please don't kill this one! One thing I'd like to see is the ability to change the order of the pics in the edit window. You can delete individual pics, but can't move one from the back to the front without deleting them all and adding them all back in a different order.","Decent app so far, I'm trying to use it for lots of files at a time and after a while it starts to crash a lot. The layout of nice all the right buttons in all the right places. Having documents save to one drive if nice. So far is good for small batchs of documents.","Awesome idea. Where are the images stored? Can a house hold share a folder for storing receipts? Like most ppl I already have images of receipts but Stack will only let me add images from photos, not from drive.

I cacncled this last year and they took another $288 out of my account May 29th. Since then it has been like pulling teeth to get my money back. They agreed to give me the money back and said it would take 5-10 buisness days that was 15 buisness days ago and no refund. Do not use this app.","It wouldn't work it just should be taken down","Great way to keep up with your hrs.","Lots of glitches. You've clocked in or out but it refreshes and then you're not. I have to make corrections constantly because if this. Also, the requirement for 24/7 location tracking is ridiculous. When I'm not clocked in, my location is no one's business.","We have been using the app for just over a year.  While it does work for the Seats we have purchased I am having an issue with purchasing new seats for additional employees.  We just got an invoice for 2 seats, we had 3 purchased but it is telling me there are only 2 available.   In addition there is NO CONTACT info on the website or the App for Help or to contact the Developer.  I found an email here on the Play store.  We'll see how fast the Developer responds and rectifies our issues.  Quickbooks is pushing me to their app so I'm getting close to pulling that trigger.  I'll report back what I find out from the Developer.   For the Cost there should be Contact info and great Customer Support.  Update:  The developer did get a hold of me and rectified my issue with the billing.  Apparently it times out and the link expires to purchase additional seats.  The issue with not having a direct Customer Service link or option in the App or on the website does still exist.  I did see that if you do not sign into your account on their website there is a Support button.  However, when you sign into your account it disappears.

I don't like that you cannot import scans to the app when you get a new device. I get that it's cloud based, and I like that when I'm on my laptop. But it's a pain on a phone to have to log into another app, look for the folder, etc etc. Would be much better if they were handy in the Rocket app. 2 clicks away.","Scans won't send to email accounts despite trying every setting combo (auto send on/off, OCR on/off, different file types etc). Support just suggest \"check your spam folders\" which Ive done, so no help at all. Also, if you sign out of the app and then back in it loses all your saved destination info so you have to enter it again! Im thinking of returning my rocketbook fusion as its practically useless with the app in this state.","This is the 2nd part to owning a Rocketbook. They work perfectly together allowing a seemless journey from note taking to destination. Great effort put in to make everything logical. If you have ever used an app and thought \"Why the **** haven't they done that?\" or \"What the **** is this for, why isn't it like I want it to be?\" then you'll be happy with this. I haven't received any money or free stuff for this review. In fact I have bought both the Fusion & Panda. They just do what I need.","OCR not working. Keeps saying that I should check my internet connection which I doubt is the reason. If a 43Mmps internet speed can not do the trick, how fast does it need for it to work. But everything else works fine so 3 stars.

I'm a premium user and I downloaded this app to curb certain addictions of mine. The only reason I went premium is because I felt like the uninstall feature would help me stay accountable. I soon realised I was wrong after the purchase because even if you turn on the uninstall feature, you can simply turn it off with 1 click and then uninstall the app. This need to be fixed. If you do fix it, I will reconsider my review.","It would be great if it actually blocked the site. The site will still populate and then you'll see a page overlapping it stating block site blocked it and you have to click out of that to go back to continue your search. Happens at least 5 times a day and I don't search the web that much. It's still very annoying just as much if not more than the site I want to block. Seems to defeat the purpose. Uninstalled.","Love your app. I honestly think you're the best App & Website Blocker out there that supports multi-platform. But it's just, i hope you'll realize WE NEED A DARK MODE toggle!!! Like come on. It is 2021 now, Dark Mode should be default design standard now these days. We have productivity and focusing to do at night too!!!","I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!! It's says free, you download, it it let's you block 1. After one you have to upgrade, you don't even get any comfort or peace of mind on knowing that this is actually doing the job before it says you need to upgrade to block anyone else.","The application didn't block or even slow down any pop- ups.

Recieved information to stop these unwanted. blocked, and other companies from coming into other secured websites continuing to put pop-ups in their websites.

Love the ability to create different folders and even include your own notes on the recipes with your personal preferences... Very cool for recipes! I was using Keep Notes, but this is so much better. If you provide password protection for the folders, then Bublup will be the only app I use for note taking and organization.","Hi, using this have been great in saving important materials I like: recipes, dance videos, crafts, friends and family. It was going well and now it shows I'm \"Temporarily Blocked.\" WHY? What is the problem? I ask that you please unblock me. I'm new at this and now its confusing. What to do?","I really do love this app. It's a MUCH better way to save (and share) content in a more visually organized, appealing & functional way than browser bookmarks/favs. Only 3 stars because it's still missing one VERY crucial feature: the ability to SAVE ITEMS TO MORE THAN ONE FOLDER AT A TIME. I save a TON of content that FREQUENTLY overlaps folder subjects. I must exit app & start over at square one EVERY time I want to save an item to an additional folder. My req for this feature was dismissed.","My favorite and most comprehensive note keeping app. It offers so much breadth in terms of how you save your media, yeah it's so simple! The interface, colors, effects are well thought out by the developers and work perfectly for someone like me who is ADHD. I need to see the functionality of an quickly app without having to listen to hours of tutorials just to learn the new folder system. Great App. I hope it sticks around because I've been raving about it too my friends","This is a good app, but dislike how you have to confirm the dialog box that says your file is now uploading (a notification that I could silence/minimize and that I don't have to dismiss would be much nicer, even if a premium feature). This app actually works for everything I need it to do, and seems to have a really good development team or else I'd notice little things being wrong while using it.

Unusable as this makes it super unreliable. Also no real dark mode","New version needs some updates for ease of use. I like the look of the new UI, and it's still useful but it's harder to get to the separate To-Do lists like Grocery and Shopping instead of it being conveniently at the bottom. I think they had the right idea initially with the layout, just keep the new aesthetic.

I also liked having the lists of my own creation underneath the weekly view, it made things easy to edit and navigate.

The plot kept me interested enough, I thought the storyline with the evil Stop-It button being defeated by the Report button was intriguing. The graphics are stunning but the real joy comes from the gameplay, oh man the joy that can come from solving the \"Write a report\" puzzle, it's incredibly confusing because the game never tells you what actually qualifies as a death threat, so it was really challenging. Overall 7.8/10 too much water. -Will Bair, scientologist","this app is a good idea, that being said it is a idea that is not ever going to be perfect. Does it give some the voices to speak up, yes, but it also increases fear in the minds of students. The fear of messing up can take over ones mind small things that don't really matter. This app is a good way to speak up but it can just as easily be used to spread hate or push someone over the edge. This is a step to fixing a problem but one that needs much improvement.","I think the app has a wonderful purpose and purely good intent behind it--I'm a 16 year old that has endured hell itself with peers. While I love the message and meaning of it, my school is so small I'm rendered unable to use it; as everyone knows everyone, and though it is anonymous someone some way or another will find out and my a$$ will promptly be kicked. The bad reviews are truly pointless to me. Before you trash talk it: think about the meaning of it.
