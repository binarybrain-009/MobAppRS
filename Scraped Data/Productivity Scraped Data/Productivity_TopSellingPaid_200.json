Your experience may vary depending on your hardware/OS it seems. This app updates frequently which is annoying because you won't be able to log in until you update or look on the website. I find myself getting randomly logged out every other month or so as well for no reason. ALSO IF YOU DONT WANT TO BUY THIS APP JUST GO TO THE WEBSITE. THE APP IS JUST A LITTLE MORE CONVENIENT","I cannot believe they are charging for this app. Not only am I being extorted to buy the app (or it's a pain to clock in), the app I PAID FOR is barely functional. Often slow and unresponsive, and the widget will freak out if I even look at it wrong. I'm sorry that your job is using this service","This app sucks. Constantly have to update it. It only works when it wants to. So the price you pay is not worth it. It should be a free app, when it screws up all the time.","Constant bugs for important things. E.g. the calendar is one day ahead all of a sudden and claims it's Friday (it's not, it's Thursday), so it says I'm scheduled for today (when I'm scheduled for Friday). It was on time all week until just today, and now it looks like I missed my shift. Luckily I worked it out with my manager, but this is unacceptable. It's too important to be bugged like this.","I have such a difficult time logging in most of the time! Today I have to go to Google Play and update the certificate. I have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times...extremely frustrating and wish my company didn't force us to use Hot Schedules! ***ZERO STARS!!!*** Update on 6/7/21. They \"upgraded\" on June 3rd and I haven't been able to log in since then! \"There was an error. Please try again later.\" Extremely frustrating and a total junk app!

I did not know about the pro and when I found out about it I got it right away. I love the fact that it goes into a cloud and that way it frees up space on my phone and I don't have to worry about downloading anywhere else to protect it. You can use it for lectures, meetings etc. It will literally record for hours mine has gone as long as 22 hrs. I left it on by accident but you can edit with pro so it's great. Also you pay 1 time ot goes with your phone #.","Perfect in every way I've ever needed it, in function AND form. I've used other similar programs over the years, okay quality, but free trials end and blah blah blah... Everything is easy to use and store and share, and the quality is good. Really glad I just went ahead and paid the handful of dollars for the straight-up Pro edition, now I'm ready to grab any idea for my music anywhere, across like three of my devices","Best decision to buy this app. & no I didn't get paid for this...I'm autistic so I like to say it as I see it. It was good with the free version & I never had any glitches on my phone but when I decided to upgrade. Let's all admit that the price is not big. People spend that much money on a coffee. Anyway the free version was good but the very affordable price of the pro will be the best move ever. 1st you get a cool app with heap's (& I do mean) heap's of very cool features. Best move ever!!","A concise, flexible, easy to use recorder that I also double as a way to store my music. My only wish was that it came with a shuffling feature other than just reorganizing things by different categories like name or file size. If you need to keep separate lists, just make sure to save them in separate folders. Also, love how easy this app is on the eyes!","This is such an awesome app, well worth it! I also love that there is a counterpart app you can install on Android Watches and it syncs recordings back to your phone.

Custom shop items and achievements title color<br>5. More improvements and bug fixes","comments":["This app is really good. I like that you can get a shop reward on completion of a certain task without having to buy it. I also like the pomodoro feature. I wish we could edit the attribute section though. Edit: I was experimenting with the synthesis feature which is also unique to this app and it's very well done. You can choose to buy something from the store with another store item or many other items like xp, coins etc","I find this app highly effective. I first scoffed at the idea of the gamification of discipline to accomplish boring/tedious/menial/taxing/important tasks. Then I tried it. I absolutely love this app. The fact that I feel so convicted for not accomplishing my tasks makes this app amazing, because I refuse to allow to gratify myself with enjoyable activities like gaming or browsing youtube until I've earned enough coins to do so, through completing the more important tasks in my life. It takes a bit to set up your own little economy, but I think I've got it down pretty well. The widget for the home screen is good.","This app is amazing, what I was expecting was not all these features and it is almost perfect. I just wish I could add more attributes. Other than that everything is perfect, not too complex, takes a few minutes to learn but worth every penny.","A super clean app that's worth the small price. Although as of now, you are unable to customise the opacity and general theme of the widget when it's in light mode, which kinda sucks... (Fear not for you dark mode users though, since you can customise that)","I enjoy it, really holds you accountable because you want to complete tasks like a video game. I hope this continues to improve as it's a more recent app. Some more features like avatars, boss battles, other quality of life improvements, etc. will take this app to the very top in my opinion."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"net.sarasarasa.lifeup","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sarasarasa.lifeup&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Simple Calendar Pro - Agenda & Schedule Planner","description":"Simple Calendar is a hugely customizable, offline calendar app for Android mobile phones designed to do exactly what an android personal calendar should do in 2021.

It would help with certain scenarios and it would be neat.","At first, nothing worked for me. But then I realized why. When doing percents, you have to put down numbers before the decimal place as a 1 in the ones place would mean 100% and saying 33 means 3300% so say .33 instead as that'll mean 33%. What I have the most issue with are the events as I can't even get them to work for me and I'm pretty sure that I'm typing things in the right places. I just can never get one actually ready for use, but rather partly constructed if you get what I mean of.","I love it, but it is kind of confusing at first, but you get used to it.

I've messaged and sent video proof of these issues and nothing has changed in over a year. I was hoping said problema would be resolved with time in \"the next update\" as they constantly tell me, yet I have the exact same problem than I did last year. If there's any chance of getting a refund I would like to request it as I've tried to deal with the glitches and wait, but this is too much!","I am so sad about this app. I thought I finally found an app that would actually do what I wanted it to, unfortunatly it's crazy bugged!! I wish I had the same experience as everyone else but honestly with the bugs, its insanely hard to use and when you zoom in, the screen goes completely black. I really hope they update it and fix all of the bugs. There is so much potential here!","i see the potential in noteshelf, its a good app when it comes to notetaking and it is still getting better with updates but but but the developers at noteshelf should see the pace at which another app called \"Flexcil\" is moving. flexcil has a ui which feels far far smoother as to what we have seen in noteshelf... noteshelf also has good amount of bugs,the pen sometimes stops working and the app crashes when minimised for too long and the scrolling is sluggish","Overall app is satisfactory, but I'm facing one serious issue right after the new update, when exporting to pdf, the output hand written text becomes automatically too thin and on top of that it even cut down the every few strokes, which ultimately made the text unreadable. Waiting for this bug to be fixed soon.

Greed has gotten this app to go from being the best to simply one of many making the money grab with subscriptions. How utterly disappointing.","This is a very cool concept, just plug your device into your computer and creates a monitor. On their website it says it can run at 60 fps, which would be awesome if it were true. With my Tab s5e, I am getting around 10-20 fps. I would say this app is a scam, but it is probably a bug, and it's at least usable despite the lag, and I contacted the support team, which were very responsive and respectful. However they could not address the issue. Until they fix the issue, I am giving them 3 stars.","Cool product, better tech support. I bought this while on vacation, had a few problems with speed. Sent an email to the dev/support and got a response very quickly. He led me through some debugging / troubleshooting steps and we finally figured out that the wi-fi where I was staying was too far away (and sub-standard). After I got home, I tried it again and it works like a charm. Thank you for getting this to work, I can see it being very helpful while traveling (to locations where I have decent internet).","I really like the idea of this app. I have all Apple products EXCEPT my Galaxy Tab S7+, simply because the Galaxy Tab is much better bang for buck, and I think just a better experience than iPad. That being said, Duet was supposed to be the app that allowed my to use my tablet as a second screen and even for drawing. But it works so poorly. I didn't even notice a difference using a wired connection. I'd pay extra to get stylus support if it worked. But it's so laggy and unreliable. Please fix.","An absolute nightmare to keep working. When it works, everything runs great besides some minor lag when drawing in apps such as photoshop. However I literally can never get it to work despite paying for the premium subscription. I got the air to connect only one single time. Half the time it won't connect be cause \"my subscritpion was canceled\" yet I have the money taken out of my account. I give up fighting with this app it isn't worth it."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.kairos.duet","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kairos.duet&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"QuickBend: Conduit Bending","description":"QuickBend is the quickest and most accurate conduit bending calculator app.\r\n\r\nQuickBend is an advanced conduit bending calculator that was created to be fast and accurate while being visually appealing, innovative, and intuitive.

Also, I selected rolling offset with an 3/4 ideal cast iron bender. Put in my height and roll but gave me ridiculous spacing between bends and doesn't tell you what degree.","The app works great, I was a bit hesitant to buy it at first, but it soon made me a believer. We all know that the deducts of older side winders or on any bender fades over time, this app has them all down and it has the travel measurements too!.. it also works if you have no signal.","My favorite tool in my tool box. This app is basically cheating. I've been able to make some incredible installs with this app. This app really becomes useful when you want to thread rigid straight and bend it to the right lengths \"mathematically\". If nothing else, I use it to reference bender specs like take up, radius and gain.","I'm an industrial electrician, I haven't had to make a segmented or consecutive bend before. I had a stick of 1\" RMC and need a 180° bend 26\" diameter at a height of 2'. I set up a greenlee 555 for the job and tested the bend on a stick of 3/4 IMC as a test \"Didn't have many 1\" sticks\". Needless to say I forgot to switch to 3/4 for the greenlee so my deduct was 2\" off. But the diameter was great.","This is a fantastic app. Years ago I made a chart for all the benders I've used on the job which included info about the start of bend, the centerline radius, the deductions and the minimum distance from the end of conduit to the shoe. It also had the formula for the developed length of a bend. I don't have to use that chart anymore.

I purchased it for use on my Chromebook but when I went to download it on my Windows 10 laptop, I'll need to purchase it again.","The overall function of the app is good but it could still use a few things. Drawing straight lines and shapes would be a nice feature to have. Being able to type on freeform pages can be useful for a number of reasons(and people). I also think it would help people a lot to have a \"insert recording\" for recording people speaking of importing one they already have","I love this app but I wish we could scroll through PDFs using arrow keys on a bluetooth keyboard, in case we do not feel like scrolling through the PDF manually. Also, it is missing voice and adding extra space in PDFs as well as support for links to be embedded in our notes. The features it does have are done very well though. Excellent text conversion, freeform pages.","fantastic app probably the best notes app pit there. however, use the notes for field notes and after a few days of notes the app got super laggy which wasn't ideal. also wish that my handwriting in annotated pdfs could be converted to text.","Overall it's a great app. Although after an update the underlining continues even when I don't want it. For example one line under the underlined title or after an underlined word. It's kinda frustrating"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.myscript.nebo","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myscript.nebo&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"INKredible PRO","description":"INKredible PRO includes all in-app purchase features of INKredible (a $9 value) plus free future updates.\r\n\r\nIt’s amazing how pen and paper, two inventions dating back to thousands of years ago, have been almost irreplaceable.

It seems numbers in titles are sorted by digits instead of value, so notebooks display in order as Chapter 1, Chapter 10, Chapter 2, Chapter 3, etc. If this is changed to sort by value then I would have no problems. It is great for notes and handwriting otherwise, but the current organization method is a little annoying.","This app changed the way I take notes on my phone and tablet. I was so comfortable with the old toolbar that the new one felt clunky at first, but after a few days of using the app, I can see the advantages of the new toolbar in the current app and how it will facilitate new features in the future. One feature I would absolutely love is to be able to import a PDF as a template/custom paper for new notes. I would like to create my own variant of one of the Productivity paper types for a work diary. Maybe, as an incentive for others to upgrade to the Pro version, you could create an online gallery where Pro users can create and upload their own paper types and share them with other Pro users?","Love this app for note taking. I am very excited to use it with my digital planner. Love the pens! Love that I can import my planner template. Would love to be able to use the hyperlinks set up in the planners as well as do some image editing. Specifically the ability to take an image and adjust its transparency.","More saving bugs! I think that there are auto save bug? Sometimes it kick me out and everything I previously wrote are gone! Nice apps, the best one currently in Android. But the new design updates is currently suck, it's not faster and it requires more click to change tools/color etc. Love the old design more. Also, split screen doesn't work properly any more. [mabe favorite toolbars for each tools? Cus changing color is much more harder with new designs, pls fix!]","Still great app! I feel bad though. I can see some people aren't happy with the new updated tool bar. It may be a little buggy but it does have potential. You guys really do care about the app and the quality of it, I'm sure you guys will figure it out. If I may suggest, maybe on the next update add the ability to customize the quick tools? I don't use the text tool much and I don't toggle palm rejection mode off and on but I do toggle closeup mode on and off and insert page action often.

When at the toolbox or hardware store. like any beloved app update welcome but this is simply smooth well made app","Very very well put together. Minimalist and extremely user friendly. There's nothing I would change or add. Completely free of ads and privacy intrusions. This app should be part of every phone's toolset and I sincerely hope the developers keep the excellence flowing.","Can you please add an option(further expand on the width and diameter) into this app. So that the user can create shapes(geometrical shapes [square, rectangle, circle, triangle, etc....) that can be assigned manual sizes (mm's & inches[example: height: mm*width:mm])) and exported as Png's?","This app seems to be extremely accurate, but I do find it a little confusing to set up & use.

I wish youd add a feature for multi future shifts, so its easier to input repeated shifts. Like for days/weeks in advance. I'd love to be able to input shifts for multiple days at once time and not input each shift separately. I'd also like an on-call option - it's different than overtime/shift differential. Like if I work 3 to 5 at normal rate but 5-6 at on call rate. It's not a whole shift, so I can't use either of those options. Color coding for shifts.","Great app. Very helpful for helping me keep track of my hours and making sure the business doesn't screw me over Haha. Unfortunately, if I can't remember my break, I think a great feature would be this app calculating simply by typing in how many hours was worked for after putting in the clock in and clock out (and leaving the break blank).","Wonderful at doing its job. Easy. Fast. To the point. Convenient widget. My only complaint: switching to another app (like a calculator or notes) and then switching back resets the view to the most recent pay period as opposed to the one you were previously on. Seems like a fragment or Nav error...","Great app for hour tracking. Love the fact you can deduct tax rates and anything else to see within pennies how much your check will be without any hassle to figure it out yourself! Amazing!!!","Works just as expected.

It's one of the very few apps that I wish the developers would have a separate \"support us\" option. I understand it's against Google's policy for that type of option, but I see you have a website soooo... Anyways keep up the good work, and thank you!","Like others, I was looking to move away from Jotterpad after their disastrous version 13 which paywalled cloud sync. QuickEdit pro is a fantastic alternative, a full featured text editor suitable for handheld or tablet use, and with fully functional dropbox sync. Effortlessly handles large files; a 70,000 word file opens, scrolls and edits as quickly as the smallest shopping list. Also runs wonderfully on Chromebook.","Problem I didn't have with the free version of the app - If I lose my net connection and try to save a file, the attempted upload to Drive gets stuck, even after I've reconnected. I then can't open the file from Drive with QE. In a roundabout way I'm able to make a copy in Drive and delete the old file. However, the old file remains in an upload loop in the bin, and can't be deleted permanently (though it may auto delete after 30 days).","Nice app with good UI. Feature missing!! If I update a file on ftp server through another editor, the changes are not reflected in same file which is already opened in QuickEdit+ editor. Once changes detected in file, it has to prompt user to reload file or ignore. File conflict occurs often without this feature. Manual reload option currently available, but also needs auto refresh feature. Auto refresh option is must for code editors. Hope this feature will be included on next update."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.rhmsoft.edit.pro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhmsoft.edit.pro&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"The Bullet Journal Companion","description":"The Bullet Journal® Companion 2.0 is designed from the ground up to help you get the most out of your BuJo® practice and your notebook.

I'm completely unable to use the app because I can't accurately represent page spreads and it feels wrong to put page 1 on page 2. I want to love this but instead I hate it.

Great app. Appreciate turning any article into a podcast. Does a pretty good job of skipping over unrelated content (ads, plugs for other articles) -- way better than read aloud in Edge. Only thing I wish it had was a way up queue up multiple articles.

Thus far it's been the best voice reader I've found and was happy to purchase the premium version (it has the honor of being the first thing i've ever bought on the app store after years of being a cheapskate). One thing I was wondering: Since there's the option to repeat a single sentence X amount of times, could it be possible to do the same with paragraphs? That'd make this app (near) perfect and something i'd appreciate greatly! Again, thanks and peace","@Voice is amazing :-) ... But I need some help with the license... I bought the premium license on my mobile. I also have a tablet and when I try to install the app there I get the option to buy the license again (even if I hit \"install\" from my library.

Reason for only 3 stars is that for some reason the task list defaults back to GMT (or close) even though I'm in a totally different time zone. The calendar copes fine with my system zone but the task list just won't accept my time zone so I'm having to \"lie\" about the future date to get it to match my calendar. I have since had contact with the developer and he has been super helpful and very quick to respond directly. Thanks Matthias!","This is a great app, but I wish tasks could be created from the calendar view, and that a location field was available in the task create/edit window. I also wish each task could have multiple notifications (alarm or email) scheduled at various intervals before the task time, like the optional notifications for events. Otherwise this app is fantastic & syncs all entered data among multiple devices, an improvement from the previous paid calendar & task app I was using.","Very good, lots of features, good performance. This calendar covers all the important calendaring functions that anyone would probably ever need, even a data repair function. As more features are added to it,though, the setting of these features are all over the place and that makes it unwieldy to use. In my opinion, I think the developer should address this \"rabit hole\" issue. Never the less, it's a worth while investment of your time.","THE best calendar I've ever found. I LOVE how customisable it is. You can make any entires or repeated entiries any colour you like. So organised!","Well worth the upgrade, this is the paid version of the non-plus app. While the other app is effectively a trial, this has all the real options like color configuration, multi-calendar default selection, etc."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"org.withouthat.acalendarplus","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.withouthat.acalendarplus&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Call Recorder License - ACR","description":"This license key removes adverts from ACR Call Recorder ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.acr ) and gives access to PREMIUM features such as\r\n\r\n- Ability to start recording in the middle of conversation via manual recording setting\r\n- Dropbox integration\r\n- Google drive integration\r\n- Auto email\r\n- Auto delete short recordings\r\nand more ..\r\n\r\nThis app is ONLY USED TO ACTIVATE PREMIUM FEATURES OF ACR,\r\nYOU NEED TO HAVE ACR INSTALLED ON YOUR PHONE.\r\n\r\nIf you don't, download it from\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.acr\r\n\r\nPlease reboot your phone after installing ACR License","descriptionHTML":"This license key removes adverts from ACR Call Recorder ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.acr ) and gives access to PREMIUM features such as<br><br>- Ability to start recording in the middle of conversation via manual recording setting<br>- Dropbox integration<br>- Google drive integration<br>- Auto email<br>- Auto delete short recordings<br>and more ..<br><br>This app is ONLY USED TO ACTIVATE PREMIUM FEATURES OF ACR,<br>YOU NEED TO HAVE ACR INSTALLED ON YOUR PHONE.<br><br>If you don&#39;t, download it from<br>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.acr<br><br>Please reboot your phone after installing ACR License","summary":"Access to premium features of ACR","installs":"500,000+","minInstalls":500000,"maxInstalls":876821,"score":2.780205,"scoreText":"2.8","ratings":37086,"reviews":19923,"histogram":{"1":17722,"2":1740,"3":1940,"4":2330,"5":13352},"price":3.99,"free":false,"currency":"USD","priceText":"$3.99","offersIAP":false,"size":"48k","androidVersion":"2.3","androidVersionText":"2.3 and up","developer":"NLL","developerId":"8530342249973296088","developerEmail":"acr@nllapps.com","developerWebsite":"http://nllapps.com/apps/acr","developerAddress":"NLL\n\n86-90 Paul Street\nLondon\nEC2A 4NE\nUNITED KINGDOM","privacyPolicy":"http://nllapps.com/apps/acr/policy.htm","developerInternalID":"8530342249973296088","genre":"Productivity","genreId":"PRODUCTIVITY","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1-06-GJG2RkHbaNueszZW9BxIBcJ5COm4qfCBGc6bXdz_RkHH5_ocs4sKbiJbfq-HbE","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5qr6FIAtbwQPXvOJYJT6xMlc6vB2yv4tepJECdH2g2mJdQlPz5_jhUmHr6t2KJAcPH4","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VwW2wPzRbHTgeP-6nw6satB_lq3QRx9aV3PT3tcPifdxD9Eche4KRX9ykNrvbC82ggo","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/o3hm03vag0Hk_0cpfouXBx4Ez7W7stMsfqKUsjALwncnZgYuu4OYpuvtI9qfcp1STBLc","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/HIUKpHDPKMwd4fYKF6-fUZWmYSQ6ulZKfJ0-U4Y0hHG-pyHZWT7tzI0JAX2I2Q_57X4","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/iQ2wsWhKTy77GbJGcPnlcdS9pwxhANhrEPJYOclQlRBiys82uZNK_IBI6WuC9H8lAJYs","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/33EcJOkAqt7Ez48TMs071wkTiKxpCxKbZqR631PICaDH-cuf5di1nIejnEitnsXIsQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/S_oZ6kSP8WQxsGF6jHblVRCimDSd_ac2s6pbClBxB7FxuRkKcEQ5s6fkzw4_oCbLk8o","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/gtnTxLZGYHb79TWzzhAH2z2SOb03qGEZoPiQC1VEfPRr1hLptMgDGK5RdROA4dGZOA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/K4YzzxeCuK789FLdJuK7Y9XIKjbVmNWTGJYx1DDwaV7OWHxS5xumD2Rpe6MUr179XkI","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Ym9WsUnLktXxT3BAIE5UUCBWmVqm07ks3m-fR_yZfaaA2s7uxG9E2qEvIOZDxEKA4bs","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/_00K8n1WKVBQzhBZeE-URn2uid2iUOHSdx1usA2E9NYAR3dtAxHHo0L0rAG3tyiE1Wk","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/PB5DB4hIu0PRUPM-WjIGGotUkoe9SeNw8rw3OayzI11CHYhGzw3iJtu9akzm60m8nJA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IHy-72OoFEHg10BxtbykGobvtrPDDJetE-ZhdsAh89bd7yosIZIbFGhtn71lzlfCbg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/kTZa7zuXgxH_T-00F6txf27kVYnHqDdouwdMe4kQ1HSKM7l3u0U9amHSxPNgNjob024","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/V5mAJRVEzcLDEj4oQXpwEJkPKmmAzd3pnQpm2TU26402z2QEqZqy4AlpttzR7QcIHJI","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/F1wJNZCAnVxoXKwC51BxPnMOe6rMUqJLh8LAhNHmIKNkJxpFFpEW-b-536wt8ZTlPg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/BRAvkhbOzNu8EuBcue9XGtWBKJxA0j_8mVCADKvzF_HagqTTF783FY-AG5X1Npq1mfg"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":false,"released":"Apr 11, 2013","updated":1598289545000,"version":"10.1","recentChanges":"Updated compatibility","comments":["As of December 2020.

It's less well known but not less in critical features, with cross platform compatibility, I use Windows and Android, I have more than ten 12 different devices and never have a problem with this little gem, exceptional stability. I especially appreciate the one off payment without being forced to a subscription. Highly recommended","I have been using this app for a long time and it gives me exactly what I need. Sync with different divices including computer and allows me to use the basics without needing to bother with extras that I don't use (however there are options available if I choose). Automatically organizes all my accounts alphabetically and I only need to memorize one password to access the app. Great Job!","UPDATED REVIEW: I wouldn't get this. It's way too finicky and unreliable. Sometimes it will pick up passwords other times it won't. I still have LastPass installed as a back up and A LOT of times LastPass will pick up the password but this app won't even prompt. It doesn't work of other browsers, and you NEED to manually input your password every 5 days, no option otherwise. Sigh. The search continues. Came over from Lastpass. Great replacement.","I have been using SafeInCloud for years, and love it!!! Every time a new and 'wonderful' password manager app comes out, I put it through its paces, and it ALWAYS comes up short.

I had tried several others, and decided to try this. Within hours, I upgraded to premium - and I feel it's 100% worth it. Kudos to the developers. Great UI, easy to use , and good support documentation if you get stuck. Can't recommend Printoid enough!","An absolute bargain. This app is far and away the best OctoPrint interface app on the market. Even without any real competition this developer continues to improve the app constantly. I got out of printing for awhile, and when I came back I couldn't believe how many improvements had been made in such a short window. This developer truly cares about the app and it's usability in a way I haven't seen before.","I've used this frequently for a couple years now, and it's the best I've found after trying several options. I'd like to make a few suggestions to the developer to make Printoid even better. 1. For the \"Automatically lock the screen\" option, let me choose the type of lock that happens. I'd like to only automatically lock critical features, because I still want to be able to zoom in on the webcam stream without unlocking. 2.

Printoid is great for what it does, but there is two other apps that does pretty much the same without having to purchase them. for stability and features, its clearly 5 stars. where it loses a star is because octoeverywhere is 3$ usd per month when it could have been developped in-app since we already have to pay for it. Also please fix when octoeverywhere trial ends, it doesn't deactivate itself and still tries to connect by that way and fails continuously even though i'm in wifi.","I paid for the premium version of this app, but after an update my remote access no longer connects to my printer.

Being able to use it on a USB stick is also excellent - I have a backup of all my documents on a stick and can access it on my backup computer or on my tablet, something I haven't been able to do with any other encryption software. (I also really really like the one-time payment rather than the subscription model !)","Well done! They included auto video uploads! Better than the commercial alternative and at a lower price (instead of annual subscription they charge for their phone apps, and it is 1 time payment - fair enough.) I also vote for features: 1. Thumbnails. 2. To have the option to choose if the original file in the phone gets deleted after being uploaded, just to save space on the phone (including the auto photo/video upload.) 3. Login to multiple accounts of same provider e.g. 2 Onedrive accounts.","Essential app for anyone what uses cloud storage and wants to keep ownership of their personal files. Really nice companion to the desktop app, and compared to VeraCrypt, Cryptomator is more geared to cloud storage, and individual files keep their directory structure (instead of just becoming a single 10GB container)","Stinks but I knew it would so no biggie. Doesn't offer grid view & doesn't do picture thumbnails (even after viewing the picture). Doesn't support Android's Storage Access Framework (SAF) so you can't open documents from apps like Office without downloading them (making editing and then uploading them manual). Boxcryptor is better in these respects but it uses a subscription model that requires an account so Cryptomator has the advantage there. Hoping it gets better, still $upportive of it!","Please add support to attach more than one Google Drive or other cloud providers drive linking system at the same time. Why to always log out from one and log in the other ? Make avail Folder upload feature also. Purchased the software to support Open Source Development.

One can concentrate and focus on one activity by using this. Prioritize the work in a better way. Procrastination would be avoided and sometimes mindabsentness. But all will work only when you determine and discipline in using it. Make it your daily routine and amazing results can be felt.","It's not working properly if I start a pomodoro then put my phone away and continue doing my work then it stops automatically and it is totally ridiculous. It shows that it's running if I start it again but later it stops automatically and many a time it doesn't ring at all even if all the settings are perfect. I am not here to report rather I need a solution to this please do make necessary updates if that helps and don't waste our valuable times.","I love this app. It help me get stuff done! Works perfectly. Love that I can adjust the work and rest times. Wish we could customize the work and rest times even more! Just add our own custom times.","Great app for productivity. I strongly recommend all users to give a try. It will really help you maximize your output and increase work efficiency as well.","This application really looks very nice, easy to use, makes me concentrate and demonstrates my family that I'm vert busy at the moment. It is the pomodoro technique itself, with very small amount of improvements. However, after I played with the settings, pomodoro started to stop after 15 minutes and I was not able to bring it back in a usual way. Finally, I had to clean the app's local cache to make it work and I lost all the tasks list. Sorry to write all this. I think the app would be better if I were able to change settings without any fear to lose everything. Two stars because the time bug in the timer app is a show-stopper. Update: even after reset cache reset, pomodoro suggests to take a cake after 15 minutes.

That was it's calculation for me. 12v, 900 watts, single 8ft run of CCA and the wire size I need is \"Holy wire size Batman\". 🤷‍♂️ So then I went to the debug mode to send a screenshot of my issue (like it said to do) and the screen was unresponsive. I clicked on email 5 or 6 times. Then I just waited. Nothing. I clicked email some more. Then waited some more. Still nothing. It needs work but feels abandoned.","Great App! I use it all the time. Helpful when calculating simple things like ohm loads, built in frequency generator including sweeps, and wiring diagrams. Definitely worth the small price that is being asked. I highly recommend for anyone into audio. Once you see and start utilizing the features it will be your go to for alot of stuff.","Great update! This is the most accurate enclosure calculator you will find! The changes to single vs multiple subs(and how cutouts affect volume with multiple subs - thanks Thomas👍), correct port volume, this is so worth it. Plus the new Cone Area Calculator is cool, the Electrical Calculators have been useful, now there's Tone Generators/Sweeps. Just get this app!","Love this app. It is very useful in calculating enclosure volume and is pretty accurate too. Deducted one star coz it doesn't have a way to save the file when you design the box like torres does. Me as a regular enclosure builder always need to save the designs for future use. Please add an option to save the enclosure design with custom naming option.","The only thing this APP can't and won't do? Make me a sandwich. Otherwise this is everything you could ever need for car audio! No more going to facebook to ask the EXPERTS. You are the expert now. Need to tune a box? Got it. Need to tune your amp? Got it Need to add a battery but unsure the size? Got it Wire in 62 new speakers? Got it! Need s new alternator? Shoot you can run more car audio now!

I am confident it will stay that way for subsequent reviews. It is that good! HamRS is a really simple logging program for amateur radio operators. It does what it needs to do with a nice clean easy to figure out and operate interface. It doesn’t need bells and whistles and other gimmicks as it does its primary job effectively. When you start up a new logbook you have 5 templates to choose from: generic, Parks on the air (POTA), Summits on the air (SOTA) and templates for field day & winter field day. These templates are set up to have boxes for “park to parks” when doing POTA etc. and it will populate the correct fields in the ADI file for upload. One feature you will grow to appreciate is that you don’t need an internet connection to use HamRS. But, if you do have a working connection once you type a call sign it will have a pop up “KC1OCA, Michael in Massachusetts” etc. And it will also report when you have been spotted on the POTA website! This makes it a lot easier to insure you have the correct call sign for your log. When you are ready HamRS allows you to export the ADI, create a duplicate of the log which is useful when you are in a park within a park etc. It also has a really neat (and Really Simple) map to display your QSLs as you make them! 73 – KC1OCA","Perfect for logging portable contacts. The one major con to this app is that the data is not cloud-based. Would REALLY love to be able to have this integrated to Drive or something similar to be able to access logs from multiple devices. This would hands-down be the best and easiest, most intuitive logging software if there was a way to share data across different devices.","Must Read!!! First while entering in the callsign field It kept deleting or doubling up my input. Total mess / no way... I found that you have to disable \"predictive text\" in my tablet settings and that helped. I'm still having a problem with the callsigns disappearing randomly (I am not direct logging I'm copying from my paper logs from the weekend). Doesn't happen every time, it's a random surprise. Running on my two year old Samsung Tablet with no know hardware issues, works fine with every other app I have. Honestly I want this thing to work but there are some bug fixes in order... Maybe it's device specific but I'd expect it to work without hassle, hoping this input helps them get it dialed in. UPDATE: Great, the program crashes too... Made it to 143 contacts, getting progressively worse as it went on and then puked. Fortunately it autosaved. Also if I click on \"QSO Map\" that crashes the app too. Honestly guys I am not impressed at all.","Great logging app, I searched and used free ones. This one is on point and has different options you can select for use. And even has a forum to submit features you'd like.","Great simple, quick entry logging software I use for POTA, FD.

Totally worth money. What I'm missing is adding multiple images from gallery at once.

Also It's sometimes hard to move line when point is at the edge of photo.","It does not actually measure it just provides a picture that you can draw lines on with your own measurements","Excellent App for what it can do. My requests to make this app better would be the following: 1. Allow integration with Adobe Acrobat/pdf editing function to add a page and text before sending. 2. Provide a feature to change the file name of the pdf being exported. In this way, the user won't have to go to a PC afterwards to do more work. 3. There is no material which describes the difference between the Lite and the paid version. Unless I missed it..","Does all the dimensions and notes on photos I need it too. I do surveys of buildings and this helps me remember exactly what I saw. Plus, it looks classy when I share the pics. One problem was that when it syncs to DB, the file name gets lost and spits out some crazy alpha numeric file name. Even at that my photos are still safe, because I share them to my photo gallery on my phone. Easy peasy.","When I had ( photo measures lite) it was working great.

Sometimes it will stay on and copy everything I copy, but sometimes it doesn't. When the app is opened and left so you can access it with the square button, it seems to work best. I am not rooted or anything. I went ahead and went into the battery settings a minute ago and took it off battery optimization to see if this would help steady things out. I'll come back for an update after a few days and see if that has helped.","Clipper aspires to meeting a real need, capturing and retaining everything copied, but the reality is that it captures clips erratically. Leaving the app running doesn't seem to matter, as is including it in \"apps that never sleep\" under battery settings. However, as it will retain multiple clips on occasion, there is proof of concept. I encourage the developer to keep working.","This is one of my favorite Apps. I was sad when it stopped working for me when I switched from MotoMod to Samsung Note Ultra 5G. Now Clipper Plus is working again. It's absolutely awesome. Thanks for all your effort. It is most appreciated. I do miss the sync across devices. No fault on your part there.","Great and working with Android 11. The reason i didn't choose 5 stars is that not every time I copy something it appears in the clipboard. Besides, sometimes even what I am copying gets to the clipboard, next day or so I don't find these copied items there although I hit the \"Save\" button. I hope this will be fixed.","It would be cool if the app did a version compatibility check before offering the opportunity to buy a pro license. I was able to refund without issue, but this doesn't seem like an oversight and more like a malicious money-grab.

If I was to critique anything I would complain that I don't have any parameters for insert drills but I guess those numbers are usually supplied by the manufacturer of said insert drills.","Great, helpful app. Suggestions: 1) add speeds and feeds for tapered end mills 2) in the materials drop-down list, show both Brinell and Rockwell C hardness, please","App is super useful. Don't regret buying it at all. Just the speed and feed part is worth the price of admission, all the bolt hole, drill point calcs are a great bonus!","One thing I'd like to see added is a reference for effective thread depth with the possible drill sizes for a given two size (for instance, if youre running a 2-56 tap and you use a #50 drill you have X% effective thread).","I have just downloaded this App and it is fantastic.

What annoys me is the fact that the app doesn't save your notes at all, so if you switch from one theme to another, reseting widgets--all your notes are gone, unless you remember to manually save them as text file.

It lacks the ability to sort or filter files, and has no image thumbnails. If a failure happens while copying files, the entire transfer fails. There is no opportunity to skip or overwrite failed files, even if the reason is that the file already exists.

Dont buy !!!","License check failed. I often travel in China, and because this app requires constant license checks it means I must always make sure I am either connected to the internet or I have VPN available which is inconvenient.

It currently implements support for the SPICE protocol.\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n(1) Some older devices are known to have issues with self-signed SSL certificates. If you find you are affected, return Opaque or ask for a refund. Please do not rate the application badly because of a platform issue!\r\n\r\n(2) On most current devices, playing sound and video exceeds the CPU processing power and causes jittery sound and video playback.\r\n\r\n(3) If virtual machines are behind a RHEV/oVirt proxy, you may need to connect to them with Opaque by using a .vv file. To get a .vv file, you have to login through the oVirt/RHEV web interface and connect to your VM's console there. Chrome works perfectly with the web interface, and opens Opaque directly. With Firefox, you have to open a File Manager, and tap the file in the Downloads folder as soon as the download completes. The built-in Android Browser does not work for .vv downloading.\r\n* System administrators: If you are planning to recommend this app, please ensure you have determined the simplest method of access for your environment.\r\n* Users: If you're unsure, please ask your System Administrator!\r\n\r\n(4) The oVirt web \"User Portal\" for oVirt v3.4 and older does not allow obtaining .vv files for virtual machines. \r\n\r\n(5) Direct connections to Proxmox VMs are now fully supported. Select Proxmox from the Virtualization Environment drop-down when adding a connection (tap the \"+\" at the main screen).\r\n\r\nCurrent features include:\r\n- Full Proxmox and oVirt/RHEV integration.\r\n- TFA / OTP Two factor authentication with Proxmox (Yubikey, Google Authenticator, etc.)\r\n- Android 4.x and earlier: USB redirection with OTG enabled devices. Connect your OTG cable prior to connecting to your VM. For some Android 4.x and Android 5.0 and later, your device must be rooted and you have to use \"SELinux Mode Changer\" (from Google Play) to set selinux to permissive mode.\r\n- Audio playback/recording\r\n- Supports both Proxmox and oVirt/RHEV virt-viewer/remote-viewer (.vv) files\r\n- Ability to edit default settings for .vv file connections or to make creation of new connections more convenient (on the main app page, tap the wrench at the top-right corner or look in the menu on older devices).\r\n- SSL encryption for peace of mind\r\n- Commercially signed and self-signed certificates  \r\n- SPICE protocol support\r\n- Automatic rotation\r\n- Desktop resizing to match display resolution\r\n- Pinch-zoom\r\n- Multi-touch UI with four mouse input modes to choose from\r\n- Mouse scrolling by swiping with two fingers up/down\r\n- Single-handed mode for easy on-the-go operation\r\n- Support for most bluetooth input devices.\r\n\r\nPlanned features:\r\n- Allocating VMs from a pool\r\n- Clipboard integration\r\n- VNC protocol support\r\n\r\nOpaque source code is GPLv3 licensed, and is available here:\r\nhttps://github.com/iiordanov/remote-desktop-clients\r\n\r\nIt also uses a number of open-source libraries included in the Gstreamer SDK for Android, as well as libcelt, openssl, libgovirt, jpeg-turbo, and librest.","descriptionHTML":"By buying this app, you are supporting an open-source project in need of resources to improve!

It currently implements support for the SPICE protocol.<br><br>NOTES<br>(1) Some older devices are known to have issues with self-signed SSL certificates. If you find you are affected, return Opaque or ask for a refund. Please do not rate the application badly because of a platform issue!<br><br>(2) On most current devices, playing sound and video exceeds the CPU processing power and causes jittery sound and video playback.<br><br>(3) If virtual machines are behind a RHEV/oVirt proxy, you may need to connect to them with Opaque by using a .vv file. To get a .vv file, you have to login through the oVirt/RHEV web interface and connect to your VM&#39;s console there. Chrome works perfectly with the web interface, and opens Opaque directly. With Firefox, you have to open a File Manager, and tap the file in the Downloads folder as soon as the download completes. The built-in Android Browser does not work for .vv downloading.<br>* System administrators: If you are planning to recommend this app, please ensure you have determined the simplest method of access for your environment.<br>* Users: If you&#39;re unsure, please ask your System Administrator!<br><br>(4) The oVirt web &quot;User Portal&quot; for oVirt v3.4 and older does not allow obtaining .vv files for virtual machines. <br><br>(5) Direct connections to Proxmox VMs are now fully supported. Select Proxmox from the Virtualization Environment drop-down when adding a connection (tap the &quot;+&quot; at the main screen).<br><br>Current features include:<br>- Full Proxmox and oVirt/RHEV integration.<br>- TFA / OTP Two factor authentication with Proxmox (Yubikey, Google Authenticator, etc.)<br>- Android 4.x and earlier: USB redirection with OTG enabled devices. Connect your OTG cable prior to connecting to your VM. For some Android 4.x and Android 5.0 and later, your device must be rooted and you have to use &quot;SELinux Mode Changer&quot; (from Google Play) to set selinux to permissive mode.<br>- Audio playback/recording<br>- Supports both Proxmox and oVirt/RHEV virt-viewer/remote-viewer (.vv) files<br>- Ability to edit default settings for .vv file connections or to make creation of new connections more convenient (on the main app page, tap the wrench at the top-right corner or look in the menu on older devices).<br>- SSL encryption for peace of mind<br>- Commercially signed and self-signed certificates  <br>- SPICE protocol support<br>- Automatic rotation<br>- Desktop resizing to match display resolution<br>- Pinch-zoom<br>- Multi-touch UI with four mouse input modes to choose from<br>- Mouse scrolling by swiping with two fingers up/down<br>- Single-handed mode for easy on-the-go operation<br>- Support for most bluetooth input devices.<br><br>Planned features:<br>- Allocating VMs from a pool<br>- Clipboard integration<br>- VNC protocol support<br><br>Opaque source code is GPLv3 licensed, and is available here:<br>https://github.com/iiordanov/remote-desktop-clients<br><br>It also uses a number of open-source libraries included in the Gstreamer SDK for Android, as well as libcelt, openssl, libgovirt, jpeg-turbo, and librest.","summary":"An oVirt, RHEV, and Proxmox client that connects to your VMs&#39; graphics console.","installs":"1,000+","minInstalls":1000,"maxInstalls":1470,"score":3.682927,"scoreText":"3.7","ratings":41,"reviews":25,"histogram":{"1":11,"2":1,"3":1,"4":5,"5":23},"price":4.99,"free":false,"currency":"USD","priceText":"$4.99","offersIAP":false,"size":"99M","androidVersion":"5.0","androidVersionText":"5.0 and up","developer":"Iordan Iordanov (Undatech)","developerId":"Iordan+Iordanov+(Undatech)","developerEmail":"support@morpheusly.com","developerWebsite":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bvnc-ardp-aspice-opaque-remote-desktop-clients","developerAddress":"260 Scarlett Road\nYork, ON M6N 4X6","privacyPolicy":"https://github.com/iiordanov/remote-desktop-clients-privacy-policy/blob/master/README.md","developerInternalID":"8264949564453373715","genre":"Productivity","genreId":"PRODUCTIVITY","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/X2fe77cIpdz6dt7ck0AUkdgGc2prkQ_NBcCC-ruJVdxg3n6EOpBHEDuq7jvLQ-LQ4A","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AUdvGi7feVlKfC9jvN_O_84r442b9b9WWiLNIvF6FqF5xx3_wq6izHIUoo61E6SNMTQ","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0nDKLVxnR2-kkwoIdrKrG9FupJBWtnDjpcx5f3rPR58Jvyum-202eF3bee15k1xNwcA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/4xElDnA0h06tiH0RC0tJ3fTI1Zce0aGHWxGYlRXgVP-dcqJWJc7Z80tgKwxgvzDSX6o","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zSrqLW3TdkVxFNq-hFuNb2-ogeVcdNFrHLVbjJC2cyNecCH-p_eCjrBGuE4JyOk-ZsF4","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/PJ7Q4TWTG2mDP6fW3WzFBKHMSIcKwhz1hokEb54LGCnKnKER3kAgEsBqgHvnby8OhdA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/heRz8eDP6Cte5Wu0Zd_2q49rAL_YE5b2dklX4tQhtVgovChnTFvIU-YMPFbFWLVWKxRC","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/jKMjNuMZeLHR9z2Icjc7-NdxdDfgdl4MxiZTtUYJg7xknlrjYDr3yFLA0dKaa8RnZ5Sa","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/NK_xZeFEvo1-BLO9N_tPM0VnQifKr6Ceg81Bw-JVWheiC02aHpk5kvwYSiWPdNT255g","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/XnXj_E3bdZj1ARXuwSmHLs_Dd7oRV1Wf61C9oQplFqUd1O805NwT6sNJYMXkURjbMg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AKhyBhb7Ofs43BtZYHrEhJ-oiUcR4vI1p5eg8_wxRz9rrQIjzkVafMXQ7JkRTRaT7lFo","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/WtmFLY-dr9-QJa70Tb13GPz-KcNAyepYh58jmndxZRySa8YDmcZJH144pYWKysJzoL6f","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/_lLP5L8XOtSAuvPg4MK5I099vfPudBUw2QCrEScOxe3HBrqepsgaBqT334SaOCbtatc","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ByN7bKm2vqVNxIxYSGyPtCn4vgV_tHHPl4A7regUtV_iVgINdPQ3xyEzejtR_7ermHgj","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ednjp6AHsP5GCb7uVFaWYaRzSPPF4Ehr_ZYQvNEY5vShNchGkb_qJk6yjQJYXE93rYo","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/WaoxqJ1hEQwglJepfVOh4-Re3Acgxf2X_Bee7R1--q8sdv1vGf5V8X8H3jl5XUCWBstJ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zE5ixws75JbnE3U2wcyIl3jvR6QXJBgrkjOYoQgm6Zz-BmdiNgNxKQnrh2eJsOb01jg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IT95iIL0hybiz7Mu5dAm6xyq-pjXCIFrfb6XYlei6jXPIz3duo_qPXda5j59KT_ttf0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IzMSFxxdTSkMQBJu9aAEsNA94JTNMurVAJyeShLFEv6eFbuj0kw86wclhOEwOklCWHU"],"video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BDqIDD-eat8?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","videoImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AUdvGi7feVlKfC9jvN_O_84r442b9b9WWiLNIvF6FqF5xx3_wq6izHIUoo61E6SNMTQ","contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":false,"released":"Feb 6, 2014","updated":1623612089000,"version":"v5.0.4","comments":["Pretty good -- importantly it works to open oVirt vv connections. Running on Chromebook. Would be improved with: copy and paste sync, Alt-Tab capture when full screen, and scrolling down has a strange effect of scrolling the whole view window on the screen rather than scrolling the window within the Spice view. Possible some of these bugs are specific to the Chromebook experience. Keep up the good work.","great program, but no mouse click or special button input is possible. I would appreciate some support with this issue. Edit: Support was provided quickly and effectively. The error was ultimately related to my VM monitor resolution and not this app. I strongly recommend both the app and the developer.","It does not work properly with the .vv files downloaded from proxmox web ui, as when it opens the .vv file the connectionto vm is done but in my tablet then all it is shown is a white background with only the mouse pointer around there.","Its slow, 32bit color, no way to switch, even when lowered resolution still was slow. Tried win10, debian, ubuntu on latest proxmox, all were slow.

To use it you enter the pool volume in gallons or liters, choose US Imperial or Metric, select which item you want to change from the drop down list and then enter the desired change in ppm or mg/l. Pool Chem Dose Calculator then lists all of the chemicals that can be used for that item change and the doses for each one. It only shows 3 chemicals on the screen. If there are more than 3 for an item, you can scroll down the list.\r\n\r\nNo brand names, no sales just the exact dose of the chemical you want to use by chemical name. Use it while you are at a pool or in the field to find out how much chemical to add to make a correction or increase or decrease a condition.\r\n\r\nSelect from the following items: \r\n\r\nIncrease Chlorine, 15 chemicals Increase Bromine 2 chemicals\r\nIncrease Alkalinity 3 chemicals Decrease Alkalinity 2 chemicals\r\nIncrease Hardness 2 chemicals Increase CYA 2 chemicals\r\nIncrease Oxidizer 1 chemical Decrease Chlorine 6 chemicals\r\nIncrease Salt 1 chemical Increase Borate 3 chemicals\r\nIncrease Copper 1 chemical.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you want to Increase Chlorine by 3 ppm in a 14,750 gallon pool, enter 14750, select US Imperial, select Increase Chlorine from the drop down menu and enter 3.0 in ppm. Instantly see the amounts needed to get 3.0 ppm chlorine in that pool for 15 types of chlorine. Makes it easy to compare and see which might be cheaper to use or make a substitution. \r\n\r\nYou can also use the Pool Chem Dose Calculator to figure out the change to a water condition if you add an amount of chemical. For instance suppose you have a 15,000 gallon pool and you want to know how much the free chlorine will increase if you add a gallon of 10% liquid chlorine. No problem, just enter the pool volume, select US Imperial, select Increase Chlorine and then enter an amount for ppm. Keep changing the ppm up or down until the dose amount for Chlorine 10% gets near 128 fl oz or 4 qts.\r\n\r\nSaves money because you get the exact dose for that pool – no more guessing. Have an emergency where too much chlorine was added and now you need to neutralize the chlorine in the pool? No problem, Just enter the pool volume, US or Metric, select Decrease Chlorine and enter the amount of chlorine you want neutralized and you get the amounts needed for 6 chlorine neutralizers. You will find this app invaluable.","descriptionHTML":"Pool Chem Dose Calculator will calculate the exact chemical dose needed for 38 chemicals in 11 categories for any size pool in US Imperial or Metric measures.

Also if you could support 3rd party hardware like a thermal infared camera! <3","I wasted $3.00 on this app, tried it twice, and then realized that there is absolutely no way a light spectrum analyzer can work with only a digital camera. You have to have something to split the spectrum like a diffraction grating or prism in order to actually to spectrum analysis. The camera has an RGB sensor just like your eye. So, let's say there is yellow at 580nm wavelight. Then there is a mix of red 650nm and green 550nm. To the RGB sensor and your eye, they look THE SAME. So, the sensor has no way to tell if it is receiving yellow light or a mix of green and red. It CANNOT work.","Does what it says, and gives consistent measurements. Can't say anything about accuracy though, as I don't have any other meters to compare it to. There are a few UI/UX issues- can't back out of screenshots; can't delete screenshots; menu is hardly intuitive (maybe is more understandable for pros? Idk.); would not measure on first run; photo metadata is movable, but if you leave it at the bottom of the screen, you can't see it in the screenshots; seems to limit how many screenshots you get.","Just got it nice simple app only took a few minutes to figure it out.

I do hope that they might pick up the torch again, but the original free version with the Pro add-on works perfectly well for me under Android 11. It is bit of a trick, though, trying to figure out where your existing version has been putting backups, or will put backups to ZIP files if you make one. I had originally set mine up to go to my microSD card, but eventually Android blocked that so Note Everything set up a noteeverything/backup folder on internal storage. I was able to snag my most recent backup from there, carry it over to my new device, and place it in internal storage under the noteeverything/backup folder there, then use the backup/restore function to get all of my notes back. I'll keep using this wonderful app for as long as Android itself allows me to. But you still can use it, you just have to snag the Note Everything base app, which the Pro add-on requires, from the developer's website, since it has not been updated recently enough to comply with the Google Play Store requirements (which are a good thing, but painful when this sort of \"disappearance\" occurs).","I've had this app for many years and have loved it. It has changed over to many new phones. I had to buy a new phone and in the process of changing things over, I lost years of notes, and I had originally bought the upgraded version of this app. No one from this app, will contact me to help me reload, and it tells me that I have to download so many things that do not help. Because of their costumer service I wish I could give it a negative rating. I need my notes, and there's no one to help.","Was good app, but unsupported for about 8 years now, and getting buggy with later OS versions.","No other note app comes close. And I've tried most. Feature rich without bloatware. I just wish it was still available.","I loved the app, especially the durable checklist. I've been using the app since probably 2012. But the backup feature does not work so everytime I get a new phone I have to manually transfer the information. That's assuming I had access to the old phone. Seeing its been 2.5 years since the last update I can't bring myself to keep using it if I'm going to invariably lose everything again."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"de.softxperience.android.noteeverythingpro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.softxperience.android.noteeverythingpro&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Handy Scanner Pro: PDF Creator","description":"Handy Scanner Pro turns your phone or tablet into a powerful document scanner.

This situation also made the app crash a couple of times over the two days of the shoot. ///// 2) the checkbox didn't fill proportionately to the time. When a shot started, the checkbox was filled up to its middle immediately and remained like that until it was checked done. I remember it filling proportionately to the time when I first downloaded the app ~8 months ago and tested it at home. ///// Also, the PDF export doesn't work with non-Latin characters (I write in Greek). On the exported PDF, all non-English words were printed as question marks. It would be nice to see this fixed; I should be able to use it equally since I paid the same price for the app as an English-speaking user. ///// Apart from those difficulties though, it's still a very good app that helped me keep track of a difficult shoot. Please fix the bugs :) Update Jul 18, 2021: The bugs haven't been fixed, plus I tried to sync a project from my tablet to my smartphone today and found no way to do so. I tried emailing an SHL file first, but when I tapped \"Share\", Shotlister wasn't in the available apps to send the file to. So then I tried to subscribe to Pro so that is syncs automatically, but when I tap \"Subscribe\" in the settings, it takes me to my current subscriptions where there's no button to subscribe to Pro. I guess you've made this app for iOS and tweaked it for Android, but it still needs lots of fixing in order to work as expected on Android. I wanted to like this app and the idea of it is very useful, but the execution unfortunately is mediocre.","Layout unusable on a Galaxy Note 9, completely falls apart. Watch out resolution of your device.","The bugs and limitations make this a pain to use. For one, on your first scene you had better give it the proper number, as you can change it a hundred times and it will always default to the original number. Which brings up the next issue - no custom scene numbering? How silly. I have my way of doing things, and the next guy has his way, and each script or project calls for varying complexity in numbering, but we have to use Shotlister's canonical numbering.","Although the UI is still slightly antiquated, the software manages to perform well in situations. Using it this last week on a shoot, I (as the sound mixer) was able to see how much time we had for some shots and also what shots were coming up throughout the day. This is useful for me because I need to know in advance which actors need to be mic'ed up, and for the shot, where to hide the mic. Shotlister has also been helpful in the past, on both op systems, keeping me on track as a director.","A really useful app for indie shoots. It definitely has a place on small productions where you have to get time management off your mind ! I recommend giving it a try. I just have some minor issues with the display options on Android, but nothing that stopped me from using it efficiently."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.reelapps.RAShotListerApp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reelapps.RAShotListerApp&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"ShiftCal® for Baltimore Fire","description":"ShiftCal for Baltimore City Fire Department displays the four-platoon Baltimore shift schedule, including vacation days, impact days, and paydays.\r\n\r\nUpdated to include support for Local 734 and Local 964.\r\n\r\nNote: this is a shift calendar, not an appointment calendar (you already have a good one on your device). \r\n\r\nShiftCal is a Registered Trademark","descriptionHTML":"ShiftCal for Baltimore City Fire Department displays the four-platoon Baltimore shift schedule, including vacation days, impact days, and paydays.<br><br>Updated to include support for Local 734 and Local 964.<br><br>Note: this is a shift calendar, not an appointment calendar (you already have a good one on your device). <br><br>ShiftCal is a Registered Trademark","summary":"Shift calendar for Baltimore City Fire Dept. displays Local 734 and Local 964","installs":"10+","minInstalls":10,"maxInstalls":46,"score":0,"scoreText":"0.0","ratings":0,"reviews":0,"histogram":{"1":0,"2":0,"3":0,"4":0,"5":0},"price":9.99,"free":false,"currency":"USD","priceText":"$9.99","offersIAP":false,"size":"Varies with device","androidVersion":"VARY","androidVersionText":"Varies with device","developer":"T.

I was intrigued when that change was made, but the novelty wore off and I wish I could go back. I hope the developer adds a way to let users choose which they prefer. Edit: it's not my job to chase the developer to make a suggestion. This is where I got the app, so this is where I make comments. My comment was obviously seen. I'd rather find a different app than play games.","When I was using it. I had constant phone calls from the bank that somebody tried to log in and I am blocked. When I dumped this app, no issues with bank anymore. Not to trust!","Terrific app. I installed the free version first, to check it out. It works very, very well - even establishing VNC connections over a secure channel (SSH, in my case) to hosts behind a firewall is straightforward to do, once you know your way around the app. I decided to get the pay version, not necessarily because I want to get extra features or get rid of the marketing window, but because I think that the developer deserves it. Notice that migrating from the free one to the pay version is painless, thanks to the Import/Export Settings capability available in both versions. Very highly recommended.","I need to know colour depth and view only settings before I connect, not what the screenshot was. I now have to long press, then press edit to get back to where I used to be upon opening the app, then Show, to get to where I need to be. For me, the new screenshot list is an added pain. However, I appreciate the continued development to my favourite VNC app :)","Highly recommended. Been using for almost 4 years to remote access Linux workstations/servers. Still the best VNC app I've found, and it's given me the ability to perform meaningful remote tasks from anywhere via my phone. Easy to set up and highly configurable - I was able to quickly set up multiple connections from private and public networks using the VNC over SSH option. Supports passwords as well as RSA keys (easy to import) for better security. Once connected you get full functionality on the remote machine. The screen can be zoomed and panned, there's full mouse functionality including left/right/middle click, and the keyboard has CRTL, ESC, arrow, etc. keys. I upgraded to the pro version in recognition of the obvious amount of work that has gone into the app. Have a problem? I found the developer very responsive via the forum."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.iiordanov.bVNC","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iiordanov.bVNC&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"CopApp !

us.

I will give 5-star rating if Developers improve above things.

After I had set up and synced the list to the second device I went to uninstall from the first one and it uninstalled from the second device also. I reinstalled the the app and connector again on the second device and logged in, but sadly the list is gone :( All that time spent wasted. So I uninstalled it all again. After first uninstall a refund was given (when I didn't want one, just remove apps from device), second time no refund. Not impressed.","I used to love the Lite version of this app, but I downloaded the full version so I can get Cloud Storage, not realizing that you need to spend MORE money for the cloud storage.

No Ads\r\n2. Small app size\r\n3. Updates\r\n4. Android Sdk 14 support\r\n \r\nWhat is BIN?\r\n\r\nBank Identification Number (“BIN”) or Issuer identification number (“IIN”) is the first six digits of a bank card number or payment cards number and it is part of ISO/IEC 7812. It is commonly used in credit cards and debit cards, stored-value cards, gift cards and other similar cards.\r\n\r\nBIN is beneficial to identify a card brand, issuing institution or bank, country of issuance, card type and category of cards. This information is very useful in commercial business for fraud prevention, especially in online store.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAKING DOWN Bank Identification Number - BIN\r\n\r\nBank identification numbers are used by other institutions, such as American Express, as well. The term \"issuer identification number\" (IIN) is used interchangeably with BIN. The numbering system helps identify identity theft or potential security breaches by comparing data, such as the address of the institution issuing the card and the address of the cardholder.\r\n\r\nHow It Works\r\n\r\nThe bank identification number is a numbering system developed by the American National Standards Institute and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to identify institutions that issue bank cards. The first digit of the BIN specifies the Major Industry Identifier (MII), such as airline, banking or travel, and the next five digits specify the issuing institution or bank. For example, the MII for a Visa credit card starts with a 4. The BIN helps merchants evaluate and assess their payment card transactions.\r\n\r\nThe BIN quickly helps a merchant identify which bank the money is being transferred from, the address and phone number of the bank, if the issuing bank is in the same country as the device used to make the transaction, and verifies the address information provided by the customer. The number allows merchants to accept multiple forms of payment and allows faster processing of transactions.\r\n\r\nWhen a customer makes an online purchase, the customer enters her card details on the payment page. After submitting the first four to six digits of the card, the online retailer can detect which institution issued the customer’s card, the card brand (such as Visa or MasterCard), the card level (such as corporate or platinum), the card type (such as a debit card or a credit card), and the issuing bank country.\r\n\r\nAuthorization\r\nThe BIN identifies which issuer receives the authorization request for the transaction to verify if the card or account is valid and whether the purchase amount is available on the card. This process results in the charge being either approved or denied.\r\n\r\nFor example, a customer stands at a gas pump and swipes her bank card. Once she swipes the card, the system scans the BIN to detect the specific issuing institution that withdraws the funds. An authorization request is put on the customer's account. The request is authorized within a few seconds, and the transaction is approved. The credit card processing system would be unable to determine the origin of the customer's funds and would be unable to complete the transaction without a BIN.\r\n\r\nAbout the BIN Check tool\r\nBIN Checker tool is designed to check the existence of a Bank Identification Number (BIN) base on updated database. Currently, there are more than +365,460 unique BIN in our database.\r\n\r\n Kindly take note that, the database is accurate but not perfect.\r\n\r\nThe tool is provided for informational purposes only. Whilst every effort is made to provide accurate data, users must acknowledge that this website accepts no liability whatsoever with respect to its accuracy. Only your bank can confirm the correct bank account information. If you are making an important payment, which is time critical, we recommend to contact your bank first.","descriptionHTML":"Pro Features<br>1. No Ads<br>2. Small app size<br>3. Updates<br>4.

The reason I like this app is because of the free-form field naming. I keep many notes that don't conform to the rigid field naming structure of most of the other password managers out there. It also lets me sync with my PC either locally, or using Dropbox. Very flexible, in my opinion. I've been using it for close to 10 years now.","Have used for years and am very happy. I use it on my computer and phone while syncing via Dropbox. I have recommended it to multiple friends.","Excellent app. I have used it for years, over multiple platforms (Windows, iOS and Android.) The only time I have had any trouble was with the fingerprint reader on my Pixel phone not working with some cryptic \"null response\" error, usually when I am in a hurry and don't have time to type in my password with my fat fingers. More (or customizable) icons would be nice. Seems like development had stalled. Regardless, is still a great product, even years after release.","Great App for managing all kinds of information, with top security. Sometimes the fingerprint reader doesn't work well with it. Also wish it had more options then just Dropbox for cloud backups.","I have used this app for years. I have experimented with competing programs but couldn’t return to Data Vault quick enough. The user interface is easy and intuitive. The platform on which this app is built is nothing shy of brilliant and expandable. Data Vault also works over sever platforms. This fact just can’t be beat. For what is worth, the app has never crashed on me. I would like to see the ability to capture an image and import said image into to program. Other than that, I am endorsing this product and recommend everyone use use it for not just password generating, but storing safely and securely whatever info one wants. Buy this product.

Installing the software and configuring it on the PC was easy and straight forward. Using it with USB-C, which is USB 3, gives smooth playback, with very little input lag. Watching YouTube or Netflix this way is also very good. The only issue is that it does use a lot of your GPU processing power, with usage sitting at 50%+. This makes it difficult to recommend for using it as a secondary monitor to watch video on whilst gaming, as it causes your frames to drop significantly, depending on the graphical requirements of the game. Minecraft with shaders turned on drops the frames from 60+fps to 40+fps. The GPU usage doesn't scale, meaning, if you lower the resolution displayed on the tablet, the GPU usage still remains high, so I suspect that there could be some tweaking left to do with the PC server. Settings the performance in the app alongside dropping the resolution still gets the same GPU usage. This is of course if getting less than 60fps constantly is unplayable for you. So personal preference. This could be why a lot of people are having problems, as integrated graphics will struggle, especially if you have older hardware. Combine that with a USB 2 cable, then it would be a nightmare. The software on the PC side has a nice UI, and is easy to use and follow, as is the software on the tablet. All in all, this is a very nice solution for when you want to be productive on your main display, whilst having some entertainment on your tablet. *** My PC has an NVIDIA GTX 1070 Gaming GPU, combined with an 8th generation Intel Core i5 6 core CPU. *** The tablet which I am using is the Galaxy s5e with Android 11 and One UI 3.1.","I was told this was going to be a good app to use for a second monitor experience and come to find out that no matter what I did to get the app going, All I got was wasted time and loosing $8. I will not be recommending this to any one any time soon","Works like a charm via usb, and the lag is totally bearable. I'm using this on my 10'' tablet as an extra monitor for my Macbook Pro (Big Sur) for programming and it's fantastic and space-saving!","It's honestly great. You DO have to know a little bit about USB2 vs USB3 max data rates if you don't want to crash the display every 5 seconds (don't attempt to use 1080p on USB 2.0) and I saw no mention of that in the desktop app, but it functions as intended as long as your hardware can take it. I was able to turn my Nexus 7 tablet into a 1080p display and it's smooth-as-butter even at full quality. If it continues to work as intended, I'd say it's well worth the $8.99.","I read all the requirements and my Amazon Fire HD10 Tablet seems to fit however when everything is connected, the Fire HD tablet seems to not pick up that the application is up and running on my PC, the tablet also supports ADB debugging and yes it is turned on. The PC is working fine because i have also tried it with my Galaxy s9 and it works but it does not say anywhere that this app is only supported with certain brands, if this can't work i would like a refund as i can take my business elsewhere...

I used YouDoodle on iOS to make silly pictures, comics, memes, etc., but the Android version falls far below the standard set by its iOS counterpart. It's practically unusable for even simple drawings. Very disappointing!","The iOS version is my favorite drawing app, but since I've moved to Android I haven't found a suitable replacement that does everything the iOS version can. This is the next best thing, but it's still lacking in a lot of features. For instance, I can't change the transparency of layers, and there's no line mode or glow option for drawing. That holds me back a lot. Please update to catch up to the iOS version!","Disappointed! I've used this app on iOS for a while but have found it completely useless since moving to android. I paid for the \"pro\" version assuming it to be at least similar to the iOS version. There's barely any fonts, you can't ad shapes to a photo, and no doubt there's many other issues that I'm yet to come across. What was the best app for my needs has become the worst.","Not even close to as good as the version on the iOS, this should be rectified. The iOS version is amazing, and I've used it for years, this version is a sad shadow of it. Edit: I've seen a lot of comments by the author of this app that say it's much cheaper on android thus the lowered quality. My message to the creator is that I will pay more for that better quality in a heartbeat. Please make a 2.99+ version I'll get it.","Despite its being much better on iOS, l decided to purchase it on here, too, as it is a great app for doodling. Moreover, it only cost 89p; whereas, it cost £2•99 on iOS. I call that fair, because some app-developers charge more for their apps on iOS than they do on here. Moreover, some charge almost twice the amount for a subscription on iOS. I shall, therefore, give you 5 stars for your fairness, as this Android version has less features."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.digitalruby.youdoodlepro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digitalruby.youdoodlepro&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Easy Offset","description":"Easy Offset is an easy to use program designed for Sheet Metal Workers that calculates cut joints, ell centerlines, and overall lengths for offsets of any angle.

I love my Droid, but OmniFocus was the one thing I really missed from iOS. There's no other system like it and it's part of all areas of focus in my life. This is pretty much the only Android solution in active development by anyone. Thank you!  PS: Like another user stated, yes, you may have to rebuild your database in order to get it to work with Focus GTD. You rebuild it and then you replace the server database with the newly rebuilt database. Otherwise the Omnifocus 2 database may continue to sync. It's really easy to do and you do not lose any of your data. Once that's done, then you're good to go 👍🏻","Ecstatic! I've been an OmniFocus user for years. Switching to Android a couple of months ago had one major drawback: no more OmniFocus on my phone... just my Mac and ipad. This solves that problem. it works great and is well worth the money. if you're an OmniFocus user this is something you need.","This is a really solid app for Omnifocus 3 users with Android devices. I primarily use OF3 on my iPad and the web, but wanted a quick option to add to and sort my inbox, track and mark complete upcoming and due, and (most importantly) sync any changes flawlessly. This app does that and the developer packs in a surprising number of additional features. I have a few feature suggestions: 1) Add Forecast view to widgets; 2) Show calendar events in Forecast view.","Great to have OmniFocus access on my Android phone. Working in a company using PC's and Android phones, I was always challenged to integrate OF into my workflows. Now with Focus GTD3 and OmniFocus web access, I can utilize OF in all my work fronts. So happy to to see the Forecast mode available, and though my Perspectives have to be utilized via my iPad, the choices available make the Android solution very workable.

I had it a couple of years ago and then got caught up in more complicated note apps, which I didn't need. After a while I started to miss the ease and simpleness of this app, so I'm back to it.  It's exactly what I need and nothing more, so I immediately bought the premium version to support the Dev.  I love everything about it, from the enlarged text (old eyes) to the dark mode, which is easier for me to see.  Keep up the great work Dmitry, there is nothing out there to equal your app in my opinion.  I won't be going to  a different app again. Five stars my man, Thank You!!","I really enjoyed the free version. Except for the inability to back up my texts, which is super important when you get a new phone.

I emailed the developer and was assisted accordingly. The issue was play store is not updating properly, so clearing the cache and storage for play store on my phone and tablet solved the issue. I just had the app for less than a day but have created several useful task to control my tablet. Very easy to use.","It's an very useful app and it works like butter, but I'm missing a feature that I like to see. I would like to have a option for automatically copying the message that you've received. Keep on going João Dias.","If you like fiddling with and tweaking android, plus doing basically anything you can find a sensor or way to communicate for.... Tasker is your app. Autoremote is a welcome extension that enables you to easily communicate between devices. Joao is literally a god with Android dev. Dunno how they do it, but Tasker gets great support, has a huge featureset, and thus far I have yet to be disappointed in any of the plugins they've written. My minor critique: There's probably a bit better of a way to get device registration and such done - the QR code is kind of awk since some devices don't fully support that OOB, and... the link was kind of a pain to figure out how to copy. My suggestion would be enabling a few other options, like NFC or Bluetooth to do this. Anyway, great app, can't find much wrong with it.","If you don't like this app, it's very likely it's because you've not taken the time to understand it. THIS PRODUCT IS FOR LIFE HACKERS. I've been using this to remotely lock my work PC for a long time. Coupled with the Chrome extension, EventGhost (on PC) and Autohotkey, you could tell your PC to email a file using Outlook with one simple push from phone. You could even have your phone tell you that someone woke your PC while you were away.","Very cool plug in. Its a bit like having a remote server to relay data between devices, while only having to make a one time payment. The only downside for me was latency with mobile networks. Not a good mix. It caused reliability issues and profiles were getting backed up. It would stop receiving, eventually bug out, then run old commands when corrected after a long retry process."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.joaomgcd.autoremote","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joaomgcd.autoremote&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Twomon SE -  Portable Display, USB Monitor","description":"*To use Twomon SE, the PC program and the manufacturer ADB driver must be installed on the PC.\r\n\r\nTwomon SE is very simple.

There have been no other apps that supported my soundbar as well as this one for example.  If your phone does have an IR-Blaster this is in my opinion the best app to use.","Brilliant app. Well worth paying to remove ads and get multi select for moving or copying. Have set up remotes for TVs, pvrs and home cinema using closest available from app then edit to match my remotes adding any missing controls and using IR codes off the web. Also added a remote with macros to control my 3 devices in the room. Only criticism is that there is not enough detailed help on using all the functionality and the help videos are in German","Great so far Though would like to have this radio pioneer remote for AVIC-VH0099 unit added soon","Does not control my visible it doesn't control my 18TDVR Box does not call control my rokia sound","The best IR Remote app is even better now with RC toy for phones without IR blaster.

Floating Widgets is most important purchase feature for me. However, Floating Widgets dont have a quick minimize to icon size button, transparency takes for Floating App icons but not for Floating Widgets :bummer. App drains massive background CPU 8/10/11 why you talking about saving juice on floating widgets. However, this baby luvs Android 9 folks- fast - no juice drain - zero hangs. I recommend it4 Android9 users only or Beware!","I've kind of been thinking that ohhh, it's the use accessibility feature that is duplicating said \"storage space\". And just now, doubleblind.","Beware that to use all features you will have pay to extra. I have already paid for the app. I should not have to pay extra to use it. Very unhappy. UNINSTALLED.","Awesome app with stellar and mobile-friendly feature. Worth give it a short. Highly recommendable app. I have already shared with my friends and made them to download this app. But miffed part is that I was not able to remove the widget of application unless I had done reboot of my phone. Pls ensure that widget can be removed easily from home screen itself by single tapping and without any impediments to get 5⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐.","Lost a star because it's not a true floating app. Definitely not the app if you're looking to open discord on top of your game like ROM:ELGLOBAL since you will time out kind of defeats a floating app. It lost another star because it's a paid application and when you open it up it asks you to subscribe yearly for more features, there is also no opt out button but the back button will work but you will get the same yearly subscription pop up every time you start the app. I could deal with the last popup but since this is not a true floating app it's a deal breaker."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"net.geekstools.floatshort.PRO","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.geekstools.floatshort.PRO&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"DrawExpress Diagram","description":"DrawExpress is a fast gesture-recognition diagram application.

The ability to get a diagram down when an idea occurs to me without needing to look for a serviette or scrap of paper is amazing. Sure, the app may have some shortcomings but it is infinitely more useful than any alternatives.","This app is almost perfect except for one little annoyance: I can see the app would open and load any .de file wherever on my phone's storage. However, after editing it, instead of saving the changes back to the file directly, the app insists on importing edited content to its own app storage. Please make the in-place saving possible for the future releases. Thanks!","please change the standard sizes of shapes to ones that their center (vertical axis and horizontal axis) aligned to grid","This is an excellent application for diagramming. The the updated look cost a star though. It is not clear how to select colors and what color is selected and the help text is inaccurate. The project selection is sort of unresponsive. Since on a phone, the project menu covers most of the screen you don't see that something changed. The predefined symbols also went away after the upgrade but has since returned, maybe due to a restart of the phone. All in all the best diagramming app I've tried.","I have been using the app to create an electrical wiring diagram for a home renovation project. You can take a picture or screenshot and import it into a drawing. Drawing little circles on the ends of wires and the terminals where you want them connected allows you to draw electrical connections and then move the objects to arrange the appearance of the wires. It's easy and efficient."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.drawexpress.full","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.drawexpress.full&hl=en&gl=us"}]
