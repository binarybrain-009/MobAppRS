PROs are simpleness, efficiency, functionality and very fast operation. CONs one of the biggest issue is that sharing files lacks manageability, signalling and transparency. You should be able to better track, start, stop, analyze what you shared and who accessed/modified shared stuff. All in all one of the best i used for cloud storage though.

You guys just get worse daily.","Look into other alternatives, Yoroi, and Emurgo by extension, have awful server consistancy and customer support. My wallet won't sync to their networks and I haven't been able to access my ADA for a while now. No phone number to call for help, sent a few emails with no responses back, kinda getting ridiculous. The only reason I didn't freak out was because I checked Twitter and saw I wasn't the only one having problems, not that Yoroi is acknowledging any of them, just crickets on their end.","The wallet still won't let me use biometrics to sign on with my galaxy s10e , even though it promotes it as a feature, also the updating of funds is often slow or even the intrawallet withdrawal is often glitchy, works, but needs a lot of work","Can be slow at times. Sometimes doesn't show my currency on curtain pages such as the dashboard, but will show up on transactions. I like that I can stake my money though.","The wallet works well for me.

Use this app in combination with the Phone Link Alexa skill.\r\n\r\nHere's what's included:\r\n\r\nADVANCED PHONE AND TABLET LOCATOR: \r\n\r\nIf your device is close by, you can make it ring - even if it's in silent mode or has the do not disturb setting turned on. If the device is further away, you can get its approximate address.  Just say something like \"Ask Phone Link to ring my phone\" or \"Ask Phone Link to find my tablet\".\r\n\r\nPHONE CALLS: \r\n\r\nYou can ask Alexa to start a phone call on your phone. It will even turn on your phone's speakerphone if you don't have a Bluetooth connection. Just say something like \"Ask phone link to call John Smith\".\r\n\r\nTEXT MESSAGING:\r\n\r\nPhone link can read out and send text messages from many popular apps, including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, your phone's SMS app, and many others. It is also able to read and reply to messages received in Gmail. It works by monitoring your notifications for incoming messages. This is the same system used by Wear OS and Android Auto. Just say something like \"Ask Phone Link to send a text to Jane Doe.\" or \"Ask Phone Link to read my messages.\"\r\n\r\nIf supported by your Alexa device, you can optionally have Alexa notify you when you have unread messages. When you see the notification light, just say \"Alexa, what did I miss?\"\r\n\r\nMUSIC AND AUDIO STREAMING:\r\n\r\nStream music and audio files stored on your Android device to your Alexa device or app, giving Alexa access to your entire mp3 collection. You can direct Alexa to play by playlist, title, album, artist, or genre. The Phone Link app can be used to set up your playlists.\r\n\r\nTo start playback, just say something like \"Ask Phone Link to play my workout playlist\" or \"Ask Phone Link to play some rock music\".\r\n\r\nWORKS WITH ECHO AUTO AND IN-CAR SYSTEMS:\r\n\r\nPhone Link works with the Echo Auto and in-car systems, providing a safe way to send and receive text messages hands-free.\r\n\r\nSUPPORTS FAMILIES AND PARENTAL MONITORING:\r\n\r\nYou can use phone link with multiple devices in your household. Just include the device's name in your voice command (e.g, \"Ask Phone Link to find John's Phone\").  Parents can use it to monitor the location of their children as well as the text messages they are receiving.\r\n\r\nCOMPATIBILITY:\r\n\r\nPhone link works with Amazon Echo devices, the Echo Auto, Fire TV, and third party devices and apps such as Ultimate Alexa.\r\n\r\nGETTING STARTED:\r\n\r\nInstall this app and follow the on-screen instructions. You can enable the Alexa skill and link it to your Amazon account within the app.\r\n\r\nPRIVACY:\r\n\r\nYour privacy is very important.

The app charges 25 cents per message/photo, each requiring approval before being available for the inmate to see. There are no guidelines listed explaining what's acceptable/not acceptable. If the message/picture isn't approved, there's no credit applied to the account. I sent my husband four pictures of his Chevelle, all were approved. Then, I sent a picture of the engine in that Chevelle, and it was declined. I sent the EXACT SAME picture again, they approved it. sigh","I have this installed on both an iPhone and droid. It is a great app when it works and I'm very thankful to have it available. . About a week ago, a forced update began causing the app not to work properly. Messages cannot be input or sent, but they can be read if you close the app and open it again. The photo icons aren't clickable either, however this will be a great feature when it's working again. The 'visit now' connects just fine and really appreciate that! If a developer, by any chance, is reading this review, I hope you're able to fix the last update so the app works again for messages and photos. If I can install an older version without a forced update, please let me know that work-around.","I dropped 60$ into this and have not gotten to use a cent. Like others had said, if you try to send a message or do anything, it just prompts you to make a deposit, and/or tells you that you don't have the funds. Well the funds are there!! Im livid. I've tried several times to contact service for help, but of course get no response. I want my money back!!! SCAM","Messaging doesn't work , viewing your profile doesn't work . the only feature that works is the deposit feature . BUT once you deposit it keeps prompting that you don't have enough money in your account to send messages that are . 34 cents! The worst part is because of covid this is about if as far as visiting or communicating with your loved one . parents trying to see their children , Siblings trying to uplift eachother only to be faced with frustration over a system that doesn't work .","This is the most fraudulent app and company ever. They take your money then never give you access. I can't even get online cause everytime I try to reset my password it goes to a blank screen. Customer service is a joke. You wait on hold forever, no one ever picks up. Their form is another joke... They don't even acknowledge that you filled one out. I've deposited 25 dollars on my account that I cant use, access or even see and they have not responded or given me a refund.

The app won't work with the device so therfore I cannot have access to the internet I pay for.This is ridiculous.Stay away!!!","Terrible! Comcast lies that this is the only way to reset your equipment and but won't let you log in! Disaster!!!! Existing customer, changing my plan. Comcast specifically states that customer service can't help. They force you to use the smartphone app. Yet in less than 10 minutes, telephone support downloaded my new plan info to my modem and Internet service was restored! App hadn't let me login! I had just logged in from my PC an hour before.","For this app being the only way -as far as I've been told- to interact fully with my Xfinity supplied Gateway modem [which I was told was the only cost-saving way to have unlimited internet] it functions rather well overall.

Creator of the app definitely understands what the people want and how they want it. When you first download the app and turn the app on it will let you know if it will work with your phone or not. (Probably to do with different operating systems and the ability to support the software used to create the app) NOTE!: my phone is a Samsung Galaxy S10 and it works great!","Easily the best torch app in the appstore. A nice, clean interface, with no permission-grab shenanigans either. The app itself has a fantastic low key approach to ads, with no pop-ups or pop-unders and definitely no intrusive or forced ads... If only every app developer behaved this way... In fact, it's so good an experience, that I'm bound to become anxious that the developers could knacker the app with some future update... Wow, did I just invent a whole new syndrome - UPDATE ANXIETY?","I really like the app. It's a flashlight so it's hard to get wrong. The main reason I downloaded it was because it supported gestures. You can turn the phone on by shaking the phone side ways twice. The problem I have with it is the app has to be running for it to work. It doesn't run in the background and I tried to enable \"Accessibility Service\" permissions to but it won't let me. If you make it to where it runs in background and I can use gestures without opening app first. 5 star app.","having to use an old phone with no build-in flashlight, this one is great. turns on right when I launch it, and I've had no issues. no intrusive ads, annoying crashes, nothing. good job 👍","The idea is good. It attempts to do what my old Motorola did without using an app. When I installed it, it told me that my Samsung S20 FE 5G is supported. Works fine for a few minutes (as long as you leave the app running). But it quickly stops responding at all, even with the sensitivity set to max.

The plot kept me interested enough, I thought the storyline with the evil Stop-It button being defeated by the Report button was intriguing. The graphics are stunning but the real joy comes from the gameplay, oh man the joy that can come from solving the \"Write a report\" puzzle, it's incredibly confusing because the game never tells you what actually qualifies as a death threat, so it was really challenging. Overall 7.8/10 too much water. -Will Bair, scientologist","this app is a good idea, that being said it is a idea that is not ever going to be perfect. Does it give some the voices to speak up, yes, but it also increases fear in the minds of students. The fear of messing up can take over ones mind small things that don't really matter. This app is a good way to speak up but it can just as easily be used to spread hate or push someone over the edge. This is a step to fixing a problem but one that needs much improvement.","I think the app has a wonderful purpose and purely good intent behind it--I'm a 16 year old that has endured hell itself with peers. While I love the message and meaning of it, my school is so small I'm rendered unable to use it; as everyone knows everyone, and though it is anonymous someone some way or another will find out and my a$$ will promptly be kicked. The bad reviews are truly pointless to me. Before you trash talk it: think about the meaning of it. Its intent is solely to help you.","Overall pretty good game good setup thought the \"report button\" could use a little bit more work. Wish the game could be cross platform so I can play with friends. Pretty challenging writing a report.","honestly the reviews are off the wall and i think they should improve to stop the nonsense reporting because if something was a crime or reporting someone doing something they shouldn't be doing all these petty reporting are wasting the police time. of course always go old school if it was emergency to call 911. as an example if there was a woman who her boyfriend was beating her and this is safest to report for help, she wont get help right away because of petty reports cops are investigating."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.stopitcyberbully.mobile","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stopitcyberbully.mobile&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"PikaShow Live TV - Free Pika Live Cricket TV Guide","description":"Get easy and easy means on the way to utilize PikaShow ForFree with Guide to get PikaShow 2021 - Free Live television program.

My opinion remains - the UX is unfriendly and unintuitive. I'm sure this makes sense to a programmer but not a user. Also, I want the ability to generate a password BEFORE I commit to creating a login. Norton has this. The method you propose assumes I am creating a login in the app, but this is not how people create logins. For $70 per year, this needs a significant overhaul. At this point, I'm seeking a refund. I thought I could put up with the issues, but it's too much.","Not sure what happened here but .... It is not the same and this is before the new versions being released. Things like stating they have Linux client when it's not really a full client, just a snap or maybe python coded program to present their web vault like a client. Then other areas where instructions were literally copy and paste credentials .... Isn't that part of the reason for a. Password Manager? Sometimes is one thing but as a necessity in some scenarios? Use BitWarden, 1Pass done","I love this app. The Family Plan and sharing vaults has been instrumental in getting my elderly parents to FINALLY get a password manager. My only feedback is that the built-in browser is very unhelpful and often has trouble rendering important websites. I wish I could configure this app to open links in a browser app of my choice by tapping the url.","Have liked this app before... this version will not allow me to enable biometric unlock and keeps crashing before I can use it to fill in a username/password. Crashes over and over. Allows me to slide the button for bio unlock, but does not ask for a fingerprint confirmation and does not enable the feature. App is currently useless.","Love it BUT.... It doesnt work on my tablet in DEX mode Samsung S7+ 5g Ultra. Really silly, cos its the only way i use my tablet. I now need to open my phone find the password stored, then go back to tablet and enter it....

However, voice to text seems to fail me often, which isn't exactly the apps issue. I have experienced multiple moments where the app freezes, and won't let me open until connecting to a Wi-Fi network. That is always a bit odd being as my mobile data is available. Not to mention, a bit annoying. There are no ads, but I have it set up this way through my settings.","It's kind of like Google drive was a while ago. It's a great app but it's buggy. As soon as you've got a bit too many files they start to have problems with snycing. As I scroll down they load and glitch out. Sometimes the files don't even show and I have to look for them in the search bar. Now it's worse than it's ever been, files that should be \"available online\" simply don't open. This didn't use to happen..","A pretty good word processor for mobile. I enjoy using it for writing, and local saving of documents is helpful. However, it can be a little janky with loading large files, and the italics button (which I use quite often for my creative writing) on Android is now squirreled away in a hard-to-find, unhelpful location, and was replaced with the checklist button. If not for that small gripe, I'd give five stars.","I really wish you would put the italics button back in the hotbar, or at least give us the option to put it there. I used it a lot, and suddenly it has vanished. Please don't direct me to the forums, as I've been trying to get a fix for this there for almost two months with zero helpful answer.","Exceptionally great app for creative minds, writers, communicators, songwriters, business minded fellows etc. It is very efficient for every day use and comes in handy when need be. The text formatting features are incredibly beautiful and second to none. It gives maximum amount of satisfaction in the neatness and appearance of documents like their desktop or laptop counterparts. I love this app super duper.

I have to close and open the app to fix it over and over, which ends up being a huge waste of time. If this can be fixed I would have no issues.","PRO: This Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) app was easy to set up and register my device. The login is convenient because it sends a notification to your phone that you must confirm. CON: This app keeps deleting the account I created, and fails to log me in. I have to call IT support almost daily to have my account recreated just to gain access to my career apps and info. This problem NEEDS to be a high priority and fixed. PERSONAL OPINION: Have your company use a different MFA app.","Regularly, I will get a notification \"do you want to authenticate\", click on it, unlock the app, and the app has forgotten about the authentication event. I have to force-quit the app and re-launch it to get the app to remember that it was in the middle of an authentication event.","This is junk. It was simple enough to get setup, but I dont get my pin in any reasonable amount of time. First try took 10 minutes. Need it again today and we are going on about an hour with no notification.

Also makes it impossible to check my voicemail through the app. Please add this functionality.","!PLEASE fix! Big issue is that the app keeps trying to reconnect whenever my laptop is on (Your Phone App still not launched) BUT the link to windows is TURNED OFF from my phone which drains a lot of battery for no reason and it is very frequent. Clicking on disconnect in the ongoing notification on the phone doesn't help either Love to use this app for connectivity with my pc don't know why screen mirroring lags even though you're sitting right next to the router.","As soon as I installed this, my pc backup and sync started re loading photos i have too many copies of as is.

I want to primarily use the screen mirroring function such that I can write with my computer keyboard (running Windows 10) instead of typing with my fingers on the phone screen (Samsung Galaxy S10e). Sounds simple enough... but no. First, my keyboard layout changes to US English despite any settings I change on the computer or the phone, i.e. the common characters åäö of my language are not accessible which makes any typing unusable. I searched like hell on different forums and finally I got it to work by enabling accessibility services for the app. Common - this needs to work by default. Second, the other text handling option that I need is copying a text on my computer (from any application) and then pasting it into the window with the phone screen mirroring. BUT IT DOESN'T WORK. HELP! Somehow the clipboard of the screen mirroring window is not shared with the clipboard of all other PC applications.

Aside from that, it is really a good app.","Nice App. But after the update in July, the available font options reduced. One can no longer select the type of font options to use.

But the loan calculator seems a bit confusing to me. The 20% of 50,000 should be 10,000, but the calculator said it's 11,074.79. For example, equal total payment for 50,000 @ 20% for 24 weeks should be 60,000 divided by 24 = 2,500 per week, but the calculator said it's 2,544.79.

This app proves that they can all be combined in an intuitive interface, plus some more obscure \"calculations\". Definitely 5 stars. If anything, the possibility to choose where the exchange rates are updated could be introduced... and a few (very few) details I will inform the developer after some more use.

You get what you pay for. Someone trying to print photos, if you don't use the app the images will never fill your paper or be to the correct size, it always shortens the width and length by a half inch no matter what.","WARNING: Return your printer before it's too late. This app has SO many problems. In order for the printer to even connect to the app, I have to open and close the app 5-6 times while turning off and on the wifi button on the printer. I have to do this almost every time for it to work. HP Smart? More like HP Dumb. I have wasted so much paper and ink because it will not let me print double sided. The only way to do it is through \"shortcuts\", but it doesnt even work through shortcuts","Still frustrated that even after all these years they still fail to offer the option to select & \"print selection\" like you can on a laptop. It's so frustrating when you only want to print out a couple of paragraphs or a recipe, that you can't simply highlight what you need, choose print, then have the option to \"print selection\". Why does this seem to be so hard for the techno guys to do this??? Waste time, ink and paper when using now & often parts of what you need dont even show up in final","It was great until today when it made me install an update before I could use it. Now the app won't connect to the printer and says it's unavailable. Grrr, I've got important stuff to scan and it won't connect. The help just says to check printer connection etc. The printer is all good, as is my phone, it's the stupid damn updated app that is the problem.","This app and service was great when I started using it, but several month ago everything went down hill. The app doesn't work properly any more. My printer is finicky and it takes half an hour to get my devices to connect to the printer and even longer to get it to print the full document.

It is so annoying to have the alarm go off and then have to wait 5 or 10 seconds through an annoying ad before I can shut that off. It especially sucks if you have someone else in the bed with you who gets up later. Yeah, the wife gets pissed off because it wakes her up completely. \"Sorry honey, just waot for the annoying ad with the jackhammer sound then go back to sleep.\" Yeah right. Silent ads are ok","Been using this app for a couple of years and it was cool, but yhe ads of the app got so annoying, somehow they keep running even when I close the app and it happens only with this app! Even when Im using other app, the ads are running with sound only. I'll have to uninstall it cuz it put me in awkward situations lately","Customer service was fast and good to work with. Still a great program. Thanks for all the help. Dean Love the program. I purchased it a while back and all was good until just recently. It now has ads. The problem is I have 3 Google accounts for different emails and it is looking at 1 that I didn't use to purchase it with. If I delete the account it shows paid. If I add it back it has ads.

The free version offers 2gb's of storage (fair enough), yet I am unable to open a 2gb file because I \"don't have enough storage (on the app)\". The device itself is brand new and has tons of storage, so that is not the issue (if that is what you were thinking). This is another predatory service offered by Google that does not work worth a damn, yet has access to your location, contacts, personal/private information, etc.","Simply the best cloud storage app in the world and I thank you sincerely for all your amazing work. It is simple, fast, convenient, good looking, functional, adaptive, and works very well. 🌟 I love to use Dropbox and the use of it helped me many times not only to backup what I wanted, but also to upload files from Dropbox into where I wanted, and that helped me many times. However, I want to have a choice for a small paid plan such as maybe 10GB to 20GB for a personal use.","This is absolutely the best cloud storage app. Thank you! It is dependable and easy to access from all of my devices. It offers plenty of space, which is important because I store a lot of information for schoolwork. I think it's great! Thanks!","I'm extremely unimpressed by Dropbox. It begins by desiring access to things it shouldn't need, with no way of letting you deny it if you need the app. Then it gives you a small amount of space for free, too small for the one thing I needed to download. WORST OF ALL: I can't even see how to delete my account. It only let's me log out. I'd give it a lower rating if I was allowed.","Everyday I find something irksome with this app. The Dropbox service is great, but this app is full of problems. It takes years to upload things - if they upload at all, spontaneous \"storage full or unavailable\" errors when trying to download, syncing issues, issues moving files, issues renaming files, issues exporting files. It never ends.

We regularly update the app with great new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. Please continue to share your feedback with us right in the app!","comments":["Overall, I love OneNote because of the ease of using across multiple devices. I use both Android and IOS so I can compare the two. I'm very disappointed that the Apple app version is far more robust than the Android version - this is a fail. The Apple version is very close to the desktop version. Android version doesn't allow for pen or paper customizations nor can you select which notebook you want to \"share\" from a program/site, it only goes to Quick Note. Android should mirror IOS.","I love this app. Ive been looking for a note taking app for a little while. Most of the apps I have used, you can't highlight or strike through. The good thing with OneNote, I can share across my devices.. and I'm able to highlight my notes, edit, add a photo straight from the camera, add an attachment, make Bullet points, add a recording. It's a word processing program for my phone.","I love OneNote; very few apps are as useful to me as OneNote has become. If I had one gripe it would be that there's no way to set it to open my notebook on launch--it always defaults to \"most recent. UPDATE: you can, sorta. You can put a shortcut on your home screen to a particular notebook.","This is the best. I am loving it. Just 2 suggestions. 1.A4 restriction (pls) - when I export all my notes into PDFs it becomes a disaster. Please make it with A4 restriction like notability and goodnotes 5. It will make it the best app for notetaking. 2. Include Draw shapes and lines feature on Android. I take my notes in S6 and it doesn't have those features in the list. It will be good if you add them. 3. Pointer - Actually Pointer in a notetaking app is so cool. Otherwise The app is 🔥🤩","Multiple interface and sync problems with this app. First of all, you can't select multiple notes at once to move them around/delete. The UI designer of this app must be some amature with no knowledge of it at all. Second of all, one of the notebooks suddenly stopped syncing at all and I can't see them anywhere on the web version of the app. Third of all, you can't move a whole section from one notebook to another. I mean, in what age are you living to not provide such a basic feature."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.microsoft.office.onenote","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.onenote&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Find My Friends","description":"Use Find My Friends app to share your realtime location with your family and friends,\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\n★ Find friends by phone number\r\n★ Realtime GPS location sharing with your friends\r\n★ Low latency location access\r\n★ Follow/Unfollow your friends\r\n★ Very low and efficient battery usage\r\n\r\n**********************************\r\n\r\nDownload now and start tracking your friends and family location.","descriptionHTML":"Use Find My Friends app to share your realtime location with your family and friends,<br><br>Features<br><br>★ Find friends by phone number<br>★ Realtime GPS location sharing with your friends<br>★ Low latency location access<br>★ Follow/Unfollow your friends<br>★ Very low and efficient battery usage<br><br>**********************************<br><br>Download now and start tracking your friends and family location.","summary":"Find My Friends app used to share your location with your family and friends.","installs":"100,000+","minInstalls":100000,"maxInstalls":480328,"score":3.764706,"scoreText":"3.8","ratings":1532,"reviews":616,"histogram":{"1":330,"2":70,"3":80,"4":200,"5":851},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$1.99 - $19.99 per item","size":"14M","androidVersion":"4.4W","androidVersionText":"4.4W and up","developer":"synchronise","developerId":"8201185554884074231","developerEmail":"contact@synchronise.in","developerWebsite":"http://synchronise.in","developerAddress":"2855,12th Main Road\nAnna Nagar\nChennai  600040","privacyPolicy":"https://sites.google.com/view/find-friends/privacy-policy","developerInternalID":"8201185554884074231","genre":"Productivity","genreId":"PRODUCTIVITY","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/dltSbCpBKEveBRF5uphQC5HJsS-oWF54mVJqqB3ChXK4hDNcQLvC7G799Ata9kET","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/OMDs4elUM1YWCGc6tFkCAdo21GuVocgVgGFZTR4CU22irZY-q28idFK9oVWfkrAqSCrh","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/HsuuOezNynh9rfkp6zCo7m3jMjj5Rt3nWNsEoVKvkpzg43v-fJ0TIVi3l8x0y1_H_js","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/22s6dj8AuovL-RvXnUvQECFnyk1Zun1Kz5MDiLZqx90ShMXpU6JtR1fgyjelD7BpD083","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/j3Drk8pM5z_BiRtjYbVramW9Yzb7TIsE2fDRvjcx4PIkrbPfkVOFwMg2RaltpSsuyzaU","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/V2a0-b3n8pUkvXORqlqR4MZayQR8hxIgZLfhUT0wxPygDkogMbcI8YJYz8Is5yulCOOA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VFeB3qw1Ue_krPyrOfiEnIJeLa8Hs0th7jkI9OsPdYQGP0N1ZWWI1oUTkLr32iFf53w","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/d4BeT4IbB-fyS_YO9quuKgZ0wtGbDjAI2zt5D4kSA2u_tHsw26ka5ZtbRGnENWk2Z9g","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/kdvjhNjimANeq5p1sGsI5fqQeNYYmIVSI0klGAZZzxiOa-5IrCwjFey0KDpuTHhqSBE","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ZfZRHLFTdoVlYZJbqy73EeXXc5lppxB3SLHoghTxYML4wSDOUMAfCvzWyJwhy4eM8CI"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Jul 22, 2019","updated":1628688302000,"version":"1.1.9","recentChanges":"★ Performance improvements and bug fixes.","comments":["Seems to be hit or miss on updating my friend's location.

I suppose this isn't a problem for if you only work one shift, but for those with variable shifts this is a downgrade in function.","Functions well, but screenshots are now misleading - there is no longer a way to see weekly schedules, only the monthly view. For those of us who work variable schedules, we have to click EVERY DAY INDIVIDUALLY to see scheduled times now, which seems a poor decision. Seriously, why the change? Was it an oversight?","New design is awful. I used to be able to see my entire week in one screen. Now I have to click on each individual day.

I can't click to another page, if I wait nothing happens, there are no directions. I can't see my network and connected devices. Maybe I should just delete this waste of space and use a different home network monitoring app. Heck, having no app at all will give me the same functionality.","The app was quick to dowoad and easy to use. It allowed me to setup and troubleshoot my network issues during my initial service setup. I could also use the app to manage devices on my network, assigning them to particular people's profiles or block their access entirely. All in all this was a very helpful little app.","App doesn't work. Just got ATT fiber and it's terrible. My connection is getting throttled and I can't even troubleshoot because this app won't let me log in. Update: was able to fix my setup. everything works as advertised but the app is overly simplistic and functionality is limited. Also running into some NATing errors but I think I can fix that.","I've had it for a few hours now. I received the \"upgraded\" modem with fiber straight to it. Have to sign in with every page change for the app. I get signed out for security reasons if I minimize the app. When I do get the page I'm looking for to make a change I can't do it. Spinning circle of eternity happens. Best part is : my internet still doesn't work. But the reps assure me everything is good. With sprint going away I didn't realize att would back fill their garbage service. Smdh","As of August 10th. I signed up and got the fiber running but this APP needs to be fixed. At&t helped me walk through it and the app would not load properly. Even the technician said AT&T needs to improve the app speed and quality. The fiber optic works fine but this app won't let me access my wifi. I have to use the url.

I had to create storage elements as \"rooms\", to have the items in them.

Used it for 4 yrs","There are issues when making notes using th s pen on the s6 lite tablet. The pen will randomly stop writing and you can only move the page. Have to close and reopen the whole app for the writing function to work again - very frustrating. Today the programme keeps crashing and am having difficulties uploading on the one drive. Not helpful when trying to work!!!","Pretty good app. I use it to scan Receiving docs. It captures very well, allowing multi page PDF's. However, its quite annoying with the constant changes when it's updated. Things like menu's. There was an update that had key menu options like renaming a document without tapping the \"edit\" button, then the next update its back to the original. The update before last allowed the app to show in dark mode, and the most recent update reverted. I still can't find any options in settings to customize.","Everything in the app is excellent except a few things: The app doesn't have dark mode. Please add a feature that allows us to invert Documents (.docx, .doc, .pdf, etc) that is Most Documents(.docx, .doc, .pdf, etc) have a white background with black text By inverting I mean to change \"black to white\" and \"white to black\" Only invert the text and background by default. Allow the user to choose which things they want to invert(text, background, images, charts, etc) Please. Finally thank you!","The app was working very well in my earlier use but lately there have been many bugs. For instance, recently it automatically deleted all notes and PDFs, document files...I am a student so I have to keep up a lot stuff here.

Allows you to track what you need to do in a day quite easily. Would definely recomend for routine building. But there are some things that could be improved. 1) Theres not much to track your daily progress. A percentage bar to tell you if you've done everything would be helpful. Adding to this, something to tell you if you've completed all habits in a category. 2) A hexadecimal system for choosing the colours on habits. So you don't have to eyeball custom colour.","Love it 🙂! I tried out tons of habit apps but this was the best. The more affordable one-time fee was a big reason, but it also met all my needs and I like using it. Categories are a must. I haven't used the rewards part yet, but that is an extra many other apps don't have. I also love that it has dark mode, I can disable all notifications, and it doesn't make sounds.","User friendly interface. Like the fact that can create habit with multi-line heading, descriptions, reasons for motivation and set up habit categories. Best is IMHO the widget which shows visually the strength of habit following using chain link and completion status. I like the detailed reminders you can set for a habit. I'm using free version so could not check premium features but based on what I saw and used so far I expect premium features to be a hit as well. Wish I had premium version.","I would give 4.5 Stars actually for such a Great, useful app. On a smaller aspect The reward section needs to be more consider.

I've been a Line 2 user for several years, never had a problem until the most recent update last February. Now it's almost unusable. Cleared data, cleared cache, uninstalled, reinstalled, still the same result. Crash. The Line2 dev guys need to fix this thing and provide an update.","It works but there is an annoying bug. Every time after a phone call, it tends to mess with my music/video audio. For example, after the phone call, all of the audio plays from my phone speaker that is only used for phone calls.

It's cuter and a lot more functional, and you can add tags to keep up with everything, kind of like hashtags. You can add pictures, agendas, lists, and even keep track of finances, as well as a lot of customization features at your disposal. I had it crash on me but support was responsive, however I recommend to people to back up often just in case it crashes. The customer service is awesome, and I will recommend this app to my folks!","I honestly don't usually write reviews but the latest update was so good that I have to sing it's praises. The slicker UI makes navigating the app, which already was good, a breeze. The new agenda features which let me plan ahead, as well as the UI making it a pleasure to use, has made me switch to using this as my main ToDo list. Fantastic! I applaud the team behind such a wonderful app. Keep up the good work!","Really cute note taking app! It's a little confusing at first but well made. It would be nice to have a feature to toggle dark mode/light mode from within the app though. Also, maybe an easier way to delete notes from the main screen! Keep up the good work!","It's still a new app, so features are limited, but I really like it! The functionality it does have works well and I really appreciate the visual customization. Can't wait to see what else the devs have in store for this gem!","Wish I didn't pay for premium. The widgets don't work,I can open the app and make agendas but I can't put it on my homescreen because the widget doesn't work for me.

You can set your own custom amount of reminders I the settings and all new tasks will automatically have those reminders. I like checking them off. Once they're checked off, they're still on a list below that you can find and reactivate. You can create subtasks. I would like to be able to set reminders hourly, however, for things like taking medicine or drinking water.","Pretty good. The link with Google Calendar is great, as is the ability to create different categories of task and to set different dates and times for subtasks. Two things that would make this nearly perfect in my view: (1) A separate standalone app for pc use, since the sidebar thing is extra clicks to get to and a computer screen is better for seeing the whole picture at once, and (2) the ability to set different colours to appear on the calendar (perhaps for different categories of task).","Gets the job done. Wish there was more list functionality. Ideally the ability to set deadlines with reminders would be fantastic. As well as the ability to change or choose how you get notified about tasks. The ability to share a task list and have it edited by multiple parties would also be useful.","This app needs more options and more control. When you make a task with subtasks it just lumps everything as tasks so the list ends up the same as any other list, no way to collapse it or know which sub items belong to which main task. It's nice that tasks can be assigned a date but the fact that the tasks are not removed after they have been checked off from calender is annoying. My calendar will have old tasks that I have already checked off and yet they still remain striked through on calenda","I *really* want to love this app and make it a part of my daily productivity. The integration with Google Calendar and the ability to create tasks from an email (in Gmail) are game changers for me, however there are two deal breakers: [1] There is no integration with the Google Assistant. This is a surprising oversight given that you can add everything else with your voice (Calendar Events, Reminders, Notes, etc). I have too many use cases where I need to add Tasks with my voice from either my phone, Google Home, or Android Auto. [2] There is no ability to share task lists with other Google users*.

The process to record and save is so simple and it keeps a record of each recording by date. Is easy to retrieve each recording and listen back to it along with the option of saving again or deleting. It's so nice to have an app that is effective and simple but so valuable. 10 stars.","I'm a journalist, and this is the only recording app thus far that doesn't spontaneously delete my recordings. Saves audio automatically, and tells you how much recordable time you have left, which is a huge plus especially when I have a long event. Plus, it's free and ads don't play as soon as you stop recording. Love this app, I've recommended it to everyone I work with. Great job.","I've recently picked up my guitar, again, after a stroke a few years ago. I'm struggling (well, it feels like a struggle to me...) to find my singing voice again.

Lets me concentrate on what I'm doing, rather than on figuring out how to opperate and record. Really glad I blundered into it!","This is the best free App for recording. My mum is in a nursing home. She is not well. My sister visits her. I am hundreds of kms away. So, I write, then record my family stories. My sister plays them to mum's great delight.

The field will be divided into colored zones (brown-yellow-green) based on the NDVI value. This helps detect problem areas.\r\nThe NDVI updates every 3-5 days if the weather is cloudless. Switch on notifications in app settings to stay on top of updates.\r\n\r\n 🗺 Automatic field boundary detection\r\n\r\nOneSoil Scouting automatically detects your field boundary using satellite images from Sentinel-2. All you need to do is select your fields by tapping them on the map.\r\n\r\n✍ Add field notes\r\n\r\nYou can either choose a pre-selected issue type (e.g., crop diseases, pests, water, weeds, plant lodging) or create a blank note. Customize your note by adding a note color, writing a comment, or adding a photo. The note will be pinned on your field map.\r\nThis app just made agronomy easier. The pins can be added remotely from the office or when you're scouting fields. In this case, the satellite can determine your exact geolocation.\r\n\r\n💪 Work offline\r\n\r\nNo Internet connection? No problem!

Sadly, they've recently made some change to the app and it no longer works on PC. I loved being able to sync across my phone and PC, keep track of lists, type out long blog posts/etc on my PC to copy and paste on my phone (save my thumbs!). But the loss of functionality on my PC is just making the app so much less of my go-to. I'll be trying to find something to replace it that does have PC sync options. But I have years of notes and lists on this app that I'll either lose or have to manually copy and paste elsewhere. Super disappointing. If all you have is Android devices, I guess it's probably still a decent app, but if you want to sync across other things, you're out of luck.","This is a fast and efficient note program. I can quickly jot something down and it has reminders. I use it to keep copies of often used text to copy & paste. You can color code notes like categories and sort them that way. I have pages of word docs that I store, so it holds a lot. You can also use it to make image notes, but I don't need to do that. It's cross platform so I can access my notes on my phone or tablet. Not so good with Windows. Overall It works great for me and recommend it.","Notes does just what I want/need w/o the bells and whistles. If you simple need notes that \"stick around\" it is far superior to a wall full of sticky notes (way old school). I will admit, it is a cross over for those of us that went through figuring out how best to keep track of notes/tasks. For you more modern guys that can keep it all in memory, it is simply redundant. 😉","I've used it for a long time, but there are some things that I wish could be done with it. For example, making a gridded list. Similar to excel, but more straight forward to use. So that specific information about stuff could easily compared to one another without needing to go to another note. I prefer using digital notepads over real ones, but if you want to do literally anything besides type words, this one can't do it.","I use this app daily for things like grocery lists and household tasks. Since I don't have much free memory on my cell phone I love that this app can be stored on a SD card. I enjoy customizing the looks of my lists and this app lets me choose the colors of my lists. I just wish hot pink or fuschia was a color option. It would be awesome if there were different color options with images.

Otherwise same functionality as desktop. But still thanks for the app, notion is the best. Android app is only useful if you use desktop version, and need something to quickly check your stuff. Not suitable for anyone who wants to use it as standalone app.","it was going great at first, but today changed my mind. yes i still love the app, it is very useful and i wont uninstall it. today, a few hours ago, notion stopped working for me, as soon as i want to open the app, it takes a long time to open the app. it still isnt working and i hope it starts working again :(","I love using this app for my personal notetaking and planning. I used the desktop version most of the time though. One problem that I'm currently facing is the text formatting bar not showing when I have my bluetooth keyboard connected, even though the new formatting toolbar for android tablet is added, I still can't use it because of this.","I really like it but it would have been perfect if there was an option to private the templates. Even if ther are no group members. Something like a pin code to access a certain page would be nice. I would love to use this for some personal space but im afraid someone might log in into my pc and might see my jounaling which they can access easily even if it is closed so i kindly request you to add password or pin option to this application. Thank you very much","Can't open links because \"there's no app to open [link]\". Have to click enter twice to go to the next line. Literally my only two uses for the app, quickly writing notes in multiple lines and opening links are impossible. I'll change the rating once those things will work properly. Also: why's the widget color based on the mode of the entire phone?

BUT this is insane; all this just to encourage you to ditch xlsx format and use Sheets instead! 2. What's also insane is Google Sheets will download as PDF!!! I discovered all this garbage when I just wanted a file available offline cuz Google Drive was slow sometimes.","None of the office related apps of Google - neither Sheets, nor Docs and Slides have been working reliably in the past year and a half. I am cannot open my own documents, thought I see a preview of them in the Drive. I am asked to sign into my account, but then I get an error that I am already signed in. It is a real shame that a company like Google can't fix its apps for years even though there were dozens of updates in that time.","Trash. You can't even edit text in a cell without having to use the \"formula\" bar... Which when using the app is ridiculous, you can't barely read what your entering or edit what's in the cell. Trying to insert a paragraph is non existent... It's 2021, there's no excuse.","Most recent version doesn't interact with Google Drive - only shows top level folders and then becomes unresponsive, having to be killed. This *doesn't* happen with Documents and Sheets, which still work perfectly normally with Drive-based documents. As a Pixel Tablet and Drive are my remote working tools, I can't currently work remotely on any spreadsheets unless I download and upload them, missing out on the integrated collaboration features.","Works great for me!

It makes it easier because of there are no ads in there. Thank you for the developer of this app, to use my phone for a short amount of time, and I'm already aware of how much time I use my phone when I downloaded and used this app.","It really helps to improve my daily mobile usage and to keep a track on apps that I have to make a limit on. It's comparison feature is a plus to this app as it make me realise that I am wasting my time more than average people on internet on some apps that I can use in other things. It hepls me improve my productivity but I think if there will be a feature of setting particular time slots for using apps than it will help me more. Overall I like this a lot.","I've found that when the display of the apps and the amount of time you used it is on \"Grid\" List Style, it tends to cause a bit of lag or slowness to show the app icon, the name of the app, and the time usage. This also happens when it's on \"Linear\" List Style mode, albeit a bit quicker, but it is still slow nevertheless. Please fix this bug. Thanks!","It really helps keep everything in check and order. It provide factual information about your usage and so on. The limits for the day are really useful. Ir would be better if you can choose to just do it in certain days though. Like have it less strict on a weekend and more strict on a weekday. Overall it's an amazing and good app. I would recommend it for anyone looking for this sort of thing.","This app DOES NOT work. I never leave reviews but I'm beyond frustrated! The app constantly tells me focus mode is on (and then blocks me) when it shouldn't be on, lets me go on apps I've blocked, etc. I appreciate the fact that it's ad-free and that it works brilliantly for everyone else, so for that reason I gave it an extra star, but I couldn't possibly give a higher rating than two stars considering all the problems I've had...

Comes with an easy to use password generator which can be altered to be as long/short/ complicated as you need. Also for good measure you can add credit card details, bank account numbers, secure contact details and notes.

I like it. Could use some polishing with the grid layout of the characters though: they're staggered, the top of their box is less rounded than the bottom, the resolution of character portraits is inconsistent, the character image background is stretched and distorted, and there are white bars at the bottom of some characters. Aside from that though, I really enjoy using the app.","This app is overall pretty great! It's informative, and in my opinion makes the genshin experience better and more organized. The only real issue i can see is the graphics which look squashed/stretched at times. A cool thing that would improve the app is recognition of a screenshot of the genshin inventory to automatically log, as logging the inventory every day can get kinda tiring. Keep it up, guys. Great app. :)","I've been using this app for months now and till now it's still my favorite place to check if I'm building my characters right.

I have had tons of problems connecting with this app and on many occasions, when I do, it has wiped out my internet connection. I used to be a huge fan of Netgear equipment. I am starting to lose confidence in the company as a whole and in their commitment to quality. Using the Rax 20 as a guest AP and for my IoT devices. Switched to ASUS for my private internal network.","I have to be as honest as possible here. The app is absolute trash. Constant freezing/ crashing on start up and when it doesn't freeze or crash its functions don't work properly 90% of the time. I'd have better luck beating my router with a coat hanger trying to edit its settings than using this app. Just log into the router manually and save yourself the headache of troubleshooting this garbage.","This is one of the worst apps ive ever used. It doesnt remember your passwords to log in, it doesnt correctly save your safety questions. It randomly forces you to log in despite remembering you, and will refuse your password no matter what. If you try to reset the password, it doesnt accept it. It forces a hard reset each time, and simply doesnt work. And dont even get me started on the bs security app it forces you to download. If you dont buy bitdefender, you cant access any website. At all.","Awful. The app crashes without fail every time it reaches the last step of my wifi router set up (verifying the phone's connection to the router's internet) I can't tell you how many times I've logged in, filled out my personalization options, waited for the verification process, only for it to inevitably crash the app. And this is the only way to set this router up? No wonder Netgear was on sale.","When I had a Motorola Z3, this app worked fine. I could control my guest wifi, check my speed and change settings. However, when I switched to Motorola one 5g, it almost never works. Whenever I try to log in, I get a message that my login attempt timed out and I should restart my phone.

I had everything up and running smoothly and ever since I downloaded the Plug-In app I have two of my printer on all my devices and sometimes I simply cannot get things to print anymore. I really wish you would try again and get an app that is all inclusive and doesn't need a separate plug in in order to continue working because for whatever reason it seems to cause confusion between devices and the actual printer.","It seems to work fine gives me an error message til it 'wakes up\". I'm still getting used to it but its sure nice to print from my phone so easily. updating review to 5 stars. excellent service and user interface, like it v much Another edit. I can fax without hooking up to a phone line, this app just keeps getting better and better!! I really love this app. While occasionally it can be a chore to set up, once it's up and running it's phenomenal. Highly recommend it.","I never used to be able to print from my phone using this app however we used to have an old WiFi printer. Now we bought a new printer the app works really well with the same phone - it's a shame that my HP laptop doesn't like printing as I have to reboot to the printer every time I want to print. So it's just easier using this app I'm my phone now anyway.","Works after several tries keeps asking for me to keep signing in wish it would just print when I want it to what happened to just clicking print and it printing now they want access to all the information about the stuff your printing as well. It's too much, simplify things please one button I push print and no more questions unless it's about printing, and you don't need all my information about how I'm using my own printer I bought.","It's great! Super easy to print on a network set up from my phone! One caveat is im not sure if it's the printer or app but after setting the setting for glossy paper photo print the quality seems to be the same on the photo. The app does not make it obvious when i go to print from another app whether that additional setting remained persistent when I clicked back to the app and printed out not.

Actually feels buggy and unfinished. I can add a pomodoro type, but not edit it. When I go back it exit the app instead of, well, going back. Dark mode keeps switching back to the light mode. No timer in notifications. I tested few pomodoro apps and this one is very limited. Sorry, but it needs much more work. Sign of the times - focused on the looks only.","This is the best app I've found so far that can keep up with my work & studies. It's visually pleasing and I love the solar system-like illustrations hehe. I think this could be made even better with a few additions like : 1. Having the option to skip breaks (cuz some ppl work for long hours straight :/) 2. Switching to next timer Automatically 3. Having a to-do list or notes or a time planner of some sort This would make it an all-in-one app which would make a brilliant app! \\^.^/","This is the best pomodoro app that I have used till date but I wish the notification tones can be changed. The moment I change it and go back to see the change, the 'cuckoo' option will be the one set. So is the case with the volume. And one thing that I would like to add is the deficit of a clock. A clock with the current colour scheme would just throw every other app out of competition","Does what it should, minus a bug. I will give 5 stars when they fix the bug I experience. I cannot turn off the cuckoo noise or change any of the alarm settings. Hitting apply and going back to settings show they dont change. Not very useful if you need to be in a public place. The sound also doesn't play in earphones, but in the phones speaker. This is due to the media type they play the sound as, not required, but it would be good to add this as a checkbox choice in the alarm settings too.","This app is very visually pleasing but the image on screen that looks like a clock actually isn't a clock and just spins around at random speeds. I'm a very visual person and need an app that will show me a visual representation of what time is left. Honestly don't understand what the point of the clock-esque image is, if anything it's distracting because it wonder what it's purpose is. Also very basic app, no settings. There are much better pomodoro apps out there."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.onceupon.pomodoro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onceupon.pomodoro&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Bublup","description":"Bublup is the easiest way to visually save, organize, and share any content, all in one place.\r\n\r\nSave links, documents, notes, videos, photos, GIFs, music, and more in visual folders with customizable pictures, titles, and descriptions for at-a-glance navigation.

However, the latter does NOT belong under the heading 'What's New'! I'm sure I'm not the only one who actually reads the 'What's New' section, which other Devs manage to use to communicate with (potential) users re new/enhanced features, issue/stability fixes, etc.","I really like the concept and idea behind this app. The one thing I don't like is the stop of my audio when I open the app while listening to music. This may because of the ads 😅. I do not mind the banner ads since they don't interfere with my doing but I don't like the pop ups. For better earning I think it's better to make an ad to unlock a certain feature. Like I want to make use a VIP template. Maybe I can unlock by watching an ad. If I want to use the template again I gotta unlock again.","I like this app better than the regular one, but this app you have to pay for items. It's not free as advertised. There are many things you can due for free, but most of everything else comes with a subscription. Which is $29.99 for life!! Not bad right??? Well everything I want to use like auto save, auto back up, and many other similar things all have to be done on a subscription. Which at this very moment today I can't pay for. Not today anyways. It does have some nice features!!","It's an ok app, although most of the features are only available for VIP members, & there are more ads than I'd prefer. Overall it's not horrible, but you might be able to find better, simpler note-apps out there ☺️","This app is the worst.. I created notes on it , it had pictures also. I worked so hard when it was created finally, I tried to share the assignment with teacher, but guess what ... It said you can only share text, or picture or snapshot ... It said to upgrade to premium to make the pdf My whole hardwork was wasted..

Stack has just launched so please send us feedback on what can be improved.","comments":["Very good app! I hope someday this can be used for official government ID. one little thing I just had trouble with is that it doesn't seem intuitive to move things between stacks. I added a document and it was in no stacks. I couldn't add it to one without downloading the PDF and sharing it to the app again, even though it already has a copy of it. minor thing but worth pointing out. I will still use this app heavily. I want to get copies of all my important documents in here.","I love everything Google; it's sync/accessibility/etc is a lifesaver. I would love a scanner app that also doubles as an organizer. While this app is off to a good start in that direction, it's still lacking features that prevent me from fully commiting to using it at the moment. The concept of organizing scanned items into folders is a huge asset for this app! However, the app NEEDS to allow the user to be able to sort said items by name/date. The sooner this function arrives, the better!!","Simple, easy to use and intuitive. Automatic backup to Drive is especially helpful. One of my favorite features is the ability to save a document to more than one stack. Unfortunately it looks like stack selection can only be made when creating a new document. I don't see an option to update which stack(s) the document is linked to after initial creation. Great job!","This app is great! One major bug that keeps it from being 5-star is that the adjustable \"color\" feature rarely keeps my manual selection. Generally, after making all my edits, the preview looks as intended. When I hit save the edited version is overridden by the original photo when the PDF is generated. Automatic color editing options are great, and I often want to use the medium and bright options. Happy to work with your team to troubleshoot. More sort options (Title A-Z) in app would be nice","I love this app. I'm documenting all of my purchases, with pics of serial numbers and receipts. They save in Google Drive as a PDF as well, so don't have to only use the app to view it. Google, please don't kill this one! One thing I'd like to see is the ability to change the order of the pics in the edit window. You can delete individual pics, but can't move one from the back to the front without deleting them all and adding them all back in a different order."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.area120.paperwork","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.area120.paperwork&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Email - Lightning Fast & Secure Mail","description":"Email by Edison is the simplified, customizable inbox experience that allows you to manage unlimited email accounts in a seamless way!

This is so easy and no reason not to do so. With modern fast SD the speed penalty is usually not noticable. Yes, many apps are guilty of the same thing, that doesn't make it right. The only way I can make space on my device is to delete other apps I use also guilty of this. Not one more!","I've only used this app for a short time, but so far, it works as advertised.
