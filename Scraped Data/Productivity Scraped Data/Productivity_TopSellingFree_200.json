The text recognition alone is so poor that it failed to recognize my address and birthday in two separate places in two separate ways despite crystal clear digital camera images. It also failed to authenticate one of my documents, and doesn't support Google voice numbers. After misrecognizing text, it does not let you fix their error or modify the information. No reupload. Clunky video chat.","This is the worst website I have ever tried to navigate through! The absolute worst! It is not user friendly, no clear instructions, just not well developed.. So sad! And customer service is only by email and waiting for a response. Why can't I speak to someone?

You get what you pay for. Someone trying to print photos, if you don't use the app the images will never fill your paper or be to the correct size, it always shortens the width and length by a half inch no matter what.","WARNING: Return your printer before it's too late. This app has SO many problems. In order for the printer to even connect to the app, I have to open and close the app 5-6 times while turning off and on the wifi button on the printer. I have to do this almost every time for it to work. HP Smart? More like HP Dumb. I have wasted so much paper and ink because it will not let me print double sided. The only way to do it is through \"shortcuts\", but it doesnt even work through shortcuts","Still frustrated that even after all these years they still fail to offer the option to select & \"print selection\" like you can on a laptop. It's so frustrating when you only want to print out a couple of paragraphs or a recipe, that you can't simply highlight what you need, choose print, then have the option to \"print selection\". Why does this seem to be so hard for the techno guys to do this??? Waste time, ink and paper when using now & often parts of what you need dont even show up in final","It was great until today when it made me install an update before I could use it. Now the app won't connect to the printer and says it's unavailable. Grrr, I've got important stuff to scan and it won't connect. The help just says to check printer connection etc. The printer is all good, as is my phone, it's the stupid damn updated app that is the problem.","This app and service was great when I started using it, but several month ago everything went down hill. The app doesn't work properly any more. My printer is finicky and it takes half an hour to get my devices to connect to the printer and even longer to get it to print the full document.

It's always take long time on my phone to open the file even if my connection is good. After takes time, sometimes it's failed. Please fix this issue. I have been using for few months still get same issue. Sometimes if I need urgent file to open, I need to turn on my computer to get faster.","Works great. Would love to have face catagorization and better search results though. I don't like that the search bar does not show albums in the results. It should show albums first if you are searching in the pictures section of the app. Aside from that so far so good. I got 1 year of 365 for 60% off by being a game pass subscriber so I'm giving the service a shot. It's good, but can be better. It's third with Amazon photos, and google photos besting it. Good work though guys. Keep it up! :)","Personally, I would say this app is the one app I use almost every day. It's great for storing everything & once you have it setup, it can in the background keep everything up to date. It isn't hard to install, setup & use. Give it a try !!","As with any Microsoft app, all things good aside from a tad of nagging issues that clearly had no thorough thinking when implemented. PROs are simpleness, efficiency, functionality and very fast operation. CONs one of the biggest issue is that sharing files lacks manageability, signalling and transparency. You should be able to better track, start, stop, analyze what you shared and who accessed/modified shared stuff. All in all one of the best i used for cloud storage though. GG","Thanks so much Samsung, thank you for putting my phone in safe mode and making it IMPOSSIBLE for me to transfer my data before I factory reset.. like there's nothing I can do to fix this, I am stuck and will probably end up losing all my valuable pictures and videos.

However, voice to text seems to fail me often, which isn't exactly the apps issue. I have experienced multiple moments where the app freezes, and won't let me open until connecting to a Wi-Fi network. That is always a bit odd being as my mobile data is available. Not to mention, a bit annoying. There are no ads, but I have it set up this way through my settings.","It's kind of like Google drive was a while ago. It's a great app but it's buggy. As soon as you've got a bit too many files they start to have problems with snycing. As I scroll down they load and glitch out. Sometimes the files don't even show and I have to look for them in the search bar. Now it's worse than it's ever been, files that should be \"available online\" simply don't open. This didn't use to happen..","A pretty good word processor for mobile. I enjoy using it for writing, and local saving of documents is helpful. However, it can be a little janky with loading large files, and the italics button (which I use quite often for my creative writing) on Android is now squirreled away in a hard-to-find, unhelpful location, and was replaced with the checklist button. If not for that small gripe, I'd give five stars.","I really wish you would put the italics button back in the hotbar, or at least give us the option to put it there. I used it a lot, and suddenly it has vanished. Please don't direct me to the forums, as I've been trying to get a fix for this there for almost two months with zero helpful answer.","Exceptionally great app for creative minds, writers, communicators, songwriters, business minded fellows etc. It is very efficient for every day use and comes in handy when need be.

But sometimes it crashes and hang, I can't even move some other items like pictures and shapes in Microsoft word. I thought my phone was the problem at first but when i bought the latest model still got the same problem. And please fix the picture png. Every time i transfer png photos it has annoying black background but it should be transparent cuz some pic overlaps. Btw this app was so helpful! Used it for 4 yrs","There are issues when making notes using th s pen on the s6 lite tablet. The pen will randomly stop writing and you can only move the page. Have to close and reopen the whole app for the writing function to work again - very frustrating. Today the programme keeps crashing and am having difficulties uploading on the one drive. Not helpful when trying to work!!!","Pretty good app. I use it to scan Receiving docs. It captures very well, allowing multi page PDF's. However, its quite annoying with the constant changes when it's updated. Things like menu's. There was an update that had key menu options like renaming a document without tapping the \"edit\" button, then the next update its back to the original. The update before last allowed the app to show in dark mode, and the most recent update reverted. I still can't find any options in settings to customize.","Everything in the app is excellent except a few things: The app doesn't have dark mode. Please add a feature that allows us to invert Documents (.docx, .doc, .pdf, etc) that is Most Documents(.docx, .doc, .pdf, etc) have a white background with black text By inverting I mean to change \"black to white\" and \"white to black\" Only invert the text and background by default. Allow the user to choose which things they want to invert(text, background, images, charts, etc) Please. Finally thank you!","The app was working very well in my earlier use but lately there have been many bugs. For instance, recently it automatically deleted all notes and PDFs, document files...I am a student so I have to keep up a lot stuff here. When 1 day during a assignment submission I opened the app, everything just disappeared! Just blank! If it wasn't for a backup on other app I would have failed 2 submit my assignment!

I can see a lot of people in the reviews don't understand this app works . First you download the app create a profile. And you share your own lock Wi-Fi with your own password so other people can use your network. Only with the password. Basically You're allowing people to use your network only if they download and connect to the app with your Wi-Fi password.","Aright I have to admit this app is great but wouldn't be better if this app was offine and if it was offline my rating would be 5 star 💫 ✨. I say that tho because it would make more sense for this app be offline not for Internet. But otherwise it's a good app.","This app is very nice because we can see password of WiFi without connected. But it not show our neighborhood wifi... We can only see others WiFi who is far from us. I think developer has to fix this problem as soon.","Worthless because nothings open on my block and the locked ones cant recieve anything so I only needed wifi for a particular game that needs data and wifi together that game is very hard to connect to plus have to go up the street all the time 1 block over has free 12 open wifis that open up makes no sense on that its annoying for neighborhoods","Apple has a different version of this app on their app store but it is still the same thing pretty much.

And not some little dinky letter. The scrollbars are a pain; I will start carefully moving up up/down and ZOOM! off she goes to where nobody knows. What is very unhelpful is how I try to insert a parenthesis and BLIP! the word I want to encapsulate is gone. Just got through an episode of trying to put \"a\" in a sentence - having it change to \"w\".","Needs more updates!! It's great for touching minor things on a current document. I would not recommend using this to make a new document for what ever that may be from start to finish. It doesn't have ALL the features or tools that you'd normally see on an actual computer. However, I think it is possible for them to incorporate more tools than it has now or at least close to it!","Not bad at all, but still stuck in 'paper world' from the previous century. Everything is pages and margins for docs that may never be printed. This app really needs a continues page option. Something similar to the 'Web Layout' you have in the desktop app. The mobile view does not support drawing. Aside from that, it is really a good app.","Nice App. But after the update in July, the available font options reduced. One can no longer select the type of font options to use. It had all the fonts available for selection, but after thr update, we have about only 10 fonts for usage. This is supposee to be an alternative to the PC version, making us able to do all we can do with our phone version too. Please kindly look into this issue. Thanks","Honestly, this app is everything I could have ever wanted. It allows me to work on the docs I created on my laptop on my phone. As a writer that often gets her best ideas while laying in bed, it's incredibly useful. The only reason it doesn't get five stars from me is because there are some bugs that could use fixing."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.microsoft.office.word","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.word&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Google Sheets","description":"Create, edit, and collaborate on spreadsheets from your Android phone or tablet with the Google Sheets app. With Sheets, you can:\r\n\r\n- Create new spreadsheets or edit existing files\r\n- Share spreadsheets and collaborate in the same spreadsheet at the same time.\r\n- Work anywhere, anytime - even offline\r\n- Add and respond to comments\r\n- Format cells, enter or sort data, view charts, insert formulas, use find/replace, and more\r\n- Never worry about losing your work – everything is saved automatically as you type\r\n- Quickly get insights, insert charts, and apply formatting with smart suggestions\r\n- Open, edit, and save Excel files.\r\n\r\nGoogle Sheets is part of Google Workspace: where teams of any size can chat, create, and collaborate.\r\n\r\nGoogle Workspace subscribers have access to additional Google Sheets features, including:\r\n- Easily add collaborators to projects, see changes as they occur, receive notifications for edits that happen while you’re away, and chat with colleagues in the same spreadsheet.

Other than this, I love this app.💜","I really like this app its help me to improve my writing skills everytime l write my story books. but the reason why I give it 3 stars because there are some issues 1. the keyboard will freeze for a second and not allow me to write anything 2.when l finished writing my notes or other stuff, the keyboard will also freeze on my screen even if I move to other app. It really bothered me to a lot, so please fix it! 🙂💙","I enjoyed it at first, then I started noticing it laggs after using it for an extensive period of time until I force stop it and run the app again, to make matters worse, it duplicates words when I try to delete, and, and if you're not careful the cursor moves back to your last text, making you delete what you've already typed. Fix this bug please, it's frustrating.","This is the best grammar and word correction app in the world! The only problem is the lack of a delete button. I can fix it ignore. My cursor will be at the right place until my keyboard pops up, then my cursor returns to the last place I typed instead. When I've written a lot, it's hard to find the word I need to delete. Please create simple delete button. I'll totally pay for it. Thanks guys, you're all awesome.","I thought it was a pretty good app at first. It really helped me add commas in the right places and with grammar. However it suggests wrong words that would make the sentence not evening make sence anymore. It also deletes words and adds letters to words making them not even words anymore. I'm uninstalling cause that is just annoying me now."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.grammarly.android.keyboard","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grammarly.android.keyboard&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"FREE QR Scanner: Barcode Scanner & QR Code Scanner","description":"The lightning QR code scanner app for Android devices to scan QR code.

However, this is an incredible app for scanning and sharing without having access to a conventional scanner. Simply amazing!!!","Used to be a great app. Now it is just full of ads. Can't use it at work anymore because so much time is lost viewing these ads as they take over my work phone. One time I tried to view an ad intentionally so they could remove the watermark from an important work document. I did it, let it lock my screen for 45 seconds with an ad, and then the send failed so I retried and sure as can be the watermark was still there on the doc. Gonna buy one of those compact blade scanners. Better image imo.","Enjoyed the features and found the app very useful. However, lately the app always crashes whenever I type the name of a document in the search box after which everything freezes and I have to close the app. I tried restarting my phone but I'm encountering the same problem.

Please work on your chat support, they can't just be transferring you all over and having to repeat your story all over again. It is not the first time it happens with the chat support and i want people downloading this app to be aware of it.","Received 1 yr free with chromebook and paid for a year, the subscription got cancelled after a year and subscription terminated, now there is no convienient way to reach support to resolve issue as the support gets terminated as well as the extra storage. I sure hope my data/backups have not permenently disappeared with that storage because it would damage the trust given to google to hold my data in the cloud.","Broken promises. Says it backs up everything. Had my phone brick itself from an update last night and once I got it working again I had to restore it from a backup as it had been factory reset. Android said there was a backup from 13 hours ago but it doesn't seem to have done anything. No messages, no wallpaper and no apps. Only the basic android cloud app list re download. Don't know why I pay them for a backup that doesn't work.","I wish Google would hire less marketing idiots to run things - this is a good example of implementation gone wrong . The alleged larger storage plan - has the fine line of being shared amongst all the family members. The so-called up to 40% discount on hotels - I have never gotten that. 2 out 3 times the so-called \"Great Deal\" price is gone or never existed in the first place and don't even try to book some place that is popular, or on the weekends.

First, my keyboard layout changes to US English despite any settings I change on the computer or the phone, i.e. the common characters åäö of my language are not accessible which makes any typing unusable. I searched like hell on different forums and finally I got it to work by enabling accessibility services for the app. Common - this needs to work by default. Second, the other text handling option that I need is copying a text on my computer (from any application) and then pasting it into the window with the phone screen mirroring. BUT IT DOESN'T WORK. HELP! Somehow the clipboard of the screen mirroring window is not shared with the clipboard of all other PC applications.

Also setting the date. If i had a alarm for December and now it's February it still has it on December. So I have to set up a new alarm ugh just talking about it is annoying. Im downloading a different appt.","I use to love this app. But the noisy ads are way too much. It scares my partner every time I go to set an alarm at night. And it annoyingly wakes him up in the morning when I go to use the app. I'm going to just attempt to use my phones built in alarm system. I'm really sad because this was my favorite app to use for my ADHD.

Still a great program. Thanks for all the help. Dean Love the program. I purchased it a while back and all was good until just recently. It now has ads.

I have had tons of problems connecting with this app and on many occasions, when I do, it has wiped out my internet connection. I used to be a huge fan of Netgear equipment. I am starting to lose confidence in the company as a whole and in their commitment to quality. Using the Rax 20 as a guest AP and for my IoT devices. Switched to ASUS for my private internal network.","I have to be as honest as possible here. The app is absolute trash. Constant freezing/ crashing on start up and when it doesn't freeze or crash its functions don't work properly 90% of the time. I'd have better luck beating my router with a coat hanger trying to edit its settings than using this app. Just log into the router manually and save yourself the headache of troubleshooting this garbage.","This is one of the worst apps ive ever used. It doesnt remember your passwords to log in, it doesnt correctly save your safety questions. It randomly forces you to log in despite remembering you, and will refuse your password no matter what. If you try to reset the password, it doesnt accept it. It forces a hard reset each time, and simply doesnt work. And dont even get me started on the bs security app it forces you to download. If you dont buy bitdefender, you cant access any website. At all.","Awful. The app crashes without fail every time it reaches the last step of my wifi router set up (verifying the phone's connection to the router's internet) I can't tell you how many times I've logged in, filled out my personalization options, waited for the verification process, only for it to inevitably crash the app. And this is the only way to set this router up? No wonder Netgear was on sale.","When I had a Motorola Z3, this app worked fine. I could control my guest wifi, check my speed and change settings. However, when I switched to Motorola one 5g, it almost never works. Whenever I try to log in, I get a message that my login attempt timed out and I should restart my phone. Restarting doesn't change anything, I still get the same message"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.netgear.netgearup","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netgear.netgearup&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Google Calendar","description":"Get the official Google Calendar app, part of Google Workspace, for your Android phone and tablet to save time and make the most of every day.\r\n\r\n• Different ways to view your calendar - Quickly switch between month, week, and day view.\r\n• Events from Gmail - Flight, hotel, concert, restaurant reservations, and more are added to your calendar automatically.\r\n• Tasks - Create, manage, and view your tasks alongside your events in Calendar\r\n• All your calendars in one place - Google Calendar works with all calendars on your phone, including Exchange.\r\n\r\nGoogle Calendar is part of Google Workspace.

The free version offers 2gb's of storage (fair enough), yet I am unable to open a 2gb file because I \"don't have enough storage (on the app)\". The device itself is brand new and has tons of storage, so that is not the issue (if that is what you were thinking). This is another predatory service offered by Google that does not work worth a damn, yet has access to your location, contacts, personal/private information, etc.","Simply the best cloud storage app in the world and I thank you sincerely for all your amazing work. It is simple, fast, convenient, good looking, functional, adaptive, and works very well. 🌟 I love to use Dropbox and the use of it helped me many times not only to backup what I wanted, but also to upload files from Dropbox into where I wanted, and that helped me many times. However, I want to have a choice for a small paid plan such as maybe 10GB to 20GB for a personal use.","This is absolutely the best cloud storage app. Thank you! It is dependable and easy to access from all of my devices. It offers plenty of space, which is important because I store a lot of information for schoolwork. I think it's great! Thanks!","I'm extremely unimpressed by Dropbox. It begins by desiring access to things it shouldn't need, with no way of letting you deny it if you need the app. Then it gives you a small amount of space for free, too small for the one thing I needed to download. WORST OF ALL: I can't even see how to delete my account. It only let's me log out. I'd give it a lower rating if I was allowed.","Everyday I find something irksome with this app. The Dropbox service is great, but this app is full of problems. It takes years to upload things - if they upload at all, spontaneous \"storage full or unavailable\" errors when trying to download, syncing issues, issues moving files, issues renaming files, issues exporting files. It never ends.

I use it to help me remember stuff. I have memory issues and I record little clips on this then have my phone alarm play the clip. This really helps. I don't have to pick up the phone to know what the alarms about. I already know because it's telling me.","This is one of the absolute best apps I have ever downloaded. Whenever I have a thought or want to record something for posterity this does the trick. Sound quality is exceptional. The process to record and save is so simple and it keeps a record of each recording by date. Is easy to retrieve each recording and listen back to it along with the option of saving again or deleting. It's so nice to have an app that is effective and simple but so valuable. 10 stars.","I'm a journalist, and this is the only recording app thus far that doesn't spontaneously delete my recordings. Saves audio automatically, and tells you how much recordable time you have left, which is a huge plus especially when I have a long event. Plus, it's free and ads don't play as soon as you stop recording. Love this app, I've recommended it to everyone I work with. Great job.","I've recently picked up my guitar, again, after a stroke a few years ago. I'm struggling (well, it feels like a struggle to me...) to find my singing voice again. Recording as I practice lets me see/hear that it's going better than I thought! The app is easy to use, which is important. Lets me concentrate on what I'm doing, rather than on figuring out how to opperate and record. Really glad I blundered into it!","This is the best free App for recording. My mum is in a nursing home. She is not well. My sister visits her. I am hundreds of kms away. So, I write, then record my family stories. My sister plays them to mum's great delight. The recordings are very clear, bright & precise. Very very Audible. Mum is pretty deaf, but, hears the storys well. I recommend this Audio Application. Brilliant. Thank you to the Developers.

It has additional collaboration features I've never used like being able to send the same document to someone else with a prompt to sign.

But the loan calculator seems a bit confusing to me. The 20% of 50,000 should be 10,000, but the calculator said it's 11,074.79. For example, equal total payment for 50,000 @ 20% for 24 weeks should be 60,000 divided by 24 = 2,500 per week, but the calculator said it's 2,544.79. Please is there something I'm missing?","I had a \"unit converterr\", a \"currency calculator\", a \"loan calculator\" and a normal calculator. This app proves that they can all be combined in an intuitive interface, plus some more obscure \"calculations\". Definitely 5 stars.

It constantly requires relogin, and a text, to start again. Then it has become so painful to navigate it us toxic. Finally, when I went through at least 20 pages just to access a listing of my package to find that it could not access it. The message, \"it's not you it's us...,\" popped up. Unbelievable!","08-14-21. - they did an update and now it's even worse. Based on the app alone I want to get rid of AT&T. Have to login 2-3 x. And chat help disappeared, they don't even want to help anymore. You have to search several pages to find a help spot. Good luck trying to actually get help. Slow, crashes, and very inefficient. Sometimes you can get help, but many times you have to hang up and call back and may get a competent person. I hate this app. Slowest of all my bills apps.","Horrid update. It doesn't display all items and makes it really slow to use. There was another update in late June to the issue and it is worse now than before. I twiddled with it for 30 minutes trying to load to pay my bill. It would cycle and boot me out of the app. This is ridiculously horrible when we think of how much a month we pay. If I wanted no customer experience I would go prepaid. They also have promotions in the app that are worthless to west coast users. So this is junk.","Sucks, I can watch the circle spin endlessly while trying to login. Actually right now I've been trying to log in for about 15 minutes to try and pay my bill. If I call cursive service they try to get me into an old login from an ex from 5 years ago and not the right one. Just sad all around. If I can't log in to pay don't expect me to pay any late fees or any other bs.","Ever since I paid off my installment plan, loading the app just brings me to the upgrading screen, and it take several minutes of back and forth with relogging and whathaveyou before it finally shows me my account. I am in the process right now of uninstalling and reinstalling it, but we'll see if that does anything. And please don't respond with, \"well, you can always pay via text or through our automated system!\" I wanted to log into the app to review my bill/account, and not just pay."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.att.myWireless","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.att.myWireless&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"PDF Document Scanner","description":"PDF Document Scanner\r\nTurn your phone into a portable document scanner with the best PDF scanner app!\r\n\"🏆 PDF Document Scanner is the Fastest and Safest mobile scan app in the google play store.

Sadly, they've recently made some change to the app and it no longer works on PC. I loved being able to sync across my phone and PC, keep track of lists, type out long blog posts/etc on my PC to copy and paste on my phone (save my thumbs!). But the loss of functionality on my PC is just making the app so much less of my go-to. I'll be trying to find something to replace it that does have PC sync options. But I have years of notes and lists on this app that I'll either lose or have to manually copy and paste elsewhere. Super disappointing. If all you have is Android devices, I guess it's probably still a decent app, but if you want to sync across other things, you're out of luck.","This is a fast and efficient note program. I can quickly jot something down and it has reminders. I use it to keep copies of often used text to copy & paste. You can color code notes like categories and sort them that way. I have pages of word docs that I store, so it holds a lot. You can also use it to make image notes, but I don't need to do that. It's cross platform so I can access my notes on my phone or tablet. Not so good with Windows. Overall It works great for me and recommend it.","Notes does just what I want/need w/o the bells and whistles. If you simple need notes that \"stick around\" it is far superior to a wall full of sticky notes (way old school). I will admit, it is a cross over for those of us that went through figuring out how best to keep track of notes/tasks. For you more modern guys that can keep it all in memory, it is simply redundant. 😉","I've used it for a long time, but there are some things that I wish could be done with it. For example, making a gridded list. Similar to excel, but more straight forward to use. So that specific information about stuff could easily compared to one another without needing to go to another note. I prefer using digital notepads over real ones, but if you want to do literally anything besides type words, this one can't do it.","I use this app daily for things like grocery lists and household tasks. Since I don't have much free memory on my cell phone I love that this app can be stored on a SD card. I enjoy customizing the looks of my lists and this app lets me choose the colors of my lists. I just wish hot pink or fuschia was a color option. It would be awesome if there were different color options with images. For example, there could be a space image color theme."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.socialnmobile.dictapps.notepad.color.note","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.socialnmobile.dictapps.notepad.color.note&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"QR Code Scanner for Android: QR Reader, QR Creator","description":"Scan codes quickly and generate QR codes with many professional logo and drawing effects for your work\r\n\r\n💡 Are you looking for a fast and user-friendly Application without paying for Barcode and QR Scanner?\r\n\r\n📣 QR Code Scanner & QR Editor is a free and most user-friendly Reader and QR Code Creator App that quickly recognizes the information of the QR code, Barcode.\r\n\r\n📣 To scan any QR code or Barcode, simply launch the App and allow access to your phone camera, pointing the camera at the code.

Also no reply in the chat screen. The ap has potential to be good when it works.","My one issue is that you have to pay so much to sell items. I think you should be able to sell items for free and wix should only take about 10% from sales.

All the stars are YOU developers ...","I purchased the \"One Time Payment\" version. I have it installed on my One-Plus 8T and love it. I also have on my Samsung Tablet and I'm disappointed. The one feature that I find most useful is the ability to \"Add to Home Screen\" function. This works great on the One-Plus but the option is not there on the Samsung Tablet. I would return the Premium version if I could.","I don't normally do reviews on apps, the app has to be impressive for me to leave a review. This app is awesome. It's easy to understand, easy to navigate and find your document or pictures, etc. No ads in your face so it leaves you alone and I love it a lot. It's never let me down and it doesn't bug me. And it allows me to DELETE my pictures as opposed to google photos. This is a great app. And that is why I am leaving this 5 star review.","Awesome app, makes it very easy and convenient to find things if you're not as technological or tech challenged like alot of people are to find certain types of files especially with a search box right above and gives you a vast array of results to your search not just exactly for what you have searched for.

The problem is that the app doesn't always load with an Android. The restaurant orders tab will sometimes just get stuck in a loading screen and I've had to uninstall it a few times to get it working again. Also, the app is a batter eater. After only having the app open for a few minutes at a time my batter will go down by over half.","It deserved a 5 star rating at the beginning, for me being a first time blogger & the fact I still have No spam from my setup email. TY! Then, it began to just throw me to the Spaces app which would freeze up completely, it did this 10 separate times, for approx 5 minutes each time. I just gave up and uninstalled for a week. I reinstalled today & found my password would not work...so reset my password, no probs. I live alone, no one has access to my phone, I have excellent virus protection.","Hi there are a lot of bugs hopefully this gets fixed in the updates. For instance, I am not able click on Bold or Italics while typing in my blog. The second one is the most annoying one. Whatever I typed, will disappear just like that and whatever I had typed 10 min before will be present. I think this is some sort of server sync issue.","Fantastic app, I'm impressed! Worked so well, I switched my domain from on to another. Thanks Wix. One thing I must add though, I am skilled in web development...haha. But for those with no skills, the plug and play is supremely easy. I do most my editing from my Android device, if that helps? So yes, awesome for a newbie! Even better for a pro, fantastic for a hacker (did I get my terminology correct? From mouth of Minecraft babes as my 7 year old would say). 'Your a newb w/ Minecraft mom'.","This was easy for me to use before, but since the changes were made my readers are prompted to download the app instead of just viewing. If I share an individual post they can opt to use the website, but when I share my wix site thats when they have to download or not go on. Also, may just be a temp glitch but the app is freezing. I get on it fine but if I click on a post it won't load. I can't build subscribers if its a hassle for them.."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.wix.admin","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wix.admin&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Google Tasks","description":"Get more done with the Google Tasks mobile app. Manage, capture, and edit your tasks from anywhere, at anytime, with to-dos that sync across all your devices.

You can set your own custom amount of reminders I the settings and all new tasks will automatically have those reminders. I like checking them off. Once they're checked off, they're still on a list below that you can find and reactivate. You can create subtasks. I would like to be able to set reminders hourly, however, for things like taking medicine or drinking water.","Pretty good. The link with Google Calendar is great, as is the ability to create different categories of task and to set different dates and times for subtasks. Two things that would make this nearly perfect in my view: (1) A separate standalone app for pc use, since the sidebar thing is extra clicks to get to and a computer screen is better for seeing the whole picture at once, and (2) the ability to set different colours to appear on the calendar (perhaps for different categories of task).","Gets the job done. Wish there was more list functionality. Ideally the ability to set deadlines with reminders would be fantastic. As well as the ability to change or choose how you get notified about tasks. The ability to share a task list and have it edited by multiple parties would also be useful.","This app needs more options and more control. When you make a task with subtasks it just lumps everything as tasks so the list ends up the same as any other list, no way to collapse it or know which sub items belong to which main task. It's nice that tasks can be assigned a date but the fact that the tasks are not removed after they have been checked off from calender is annoying. My calendar will have old tasks that I have already checked off and yet they still remain striked through on calenda","I *really* want to love this app and make it a part of my daily productivity. The integration with Google Calendar and the ability to create tasks from an email (in Gmail) are game changers for me, however there are two deal breakers: [1] There is no integration with the Google Assistant. This is a surprising oversight given that you can add everything else with your voice (Calendar Events, Reminders, Notes, etc). I have too many use cases where I need to add Tasks with my voice from either my phone, Google Home, or Android Auto. [2] There is no ability to share task lists with other Google users*.

This may because of the ads 😅. I do not mind the banner ads since they don't interfere with my doing but I don't like the pop ups. For better earning I think it's better to make an ad to unlock a certain feature. Like I want to make use a VIP template. Maybe I can unlock by watching an ad. If I want to use the template again I gotta unlock again.","I like this app better than the regular one, but this app you have to pay for items. It's not free as advertised. There are many things you can due for free, but most of everything else comes with a subscription. Which is $29.99 for life!! Not bad right???

We regularly update the app with great new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. Please continue to share your feedback with us right in the app!","comments":["Overall, I love OneNote because of the ease of using across multiple devices. I use both Android and IOS so I can compare the two. I'm very disappointed that the Apple app version is far more robust than the Android version - this is a fail. The Apple version is very close to the desktop version. Android version doesn't allow for pen or paper customizations nor can you select which notebook you want to \"share\" from a program/site, it only goes to Quick Note. Android should mirror IOS.","I love this app. Ive been looking for a note taking app for a little while. Most of the apps I have used, you can't highlight or strike through. The good thing with OneNote, I can share across my devices.. and I'm able to highlight my notes, edit, add a photo straight from the camera, add an attachment, make Bullet points, add a recording. It's a word processing program for my phone.","I love OneNote; very few apps are as useful to me as OneNote has become. If I had one gripe it would be that there's no way to set it to open my notebook on launch--it always defaults to \"most recent. UPDATE: you can, sorta. You can put a shortcut on your home screen to a particular notebook.","This is the best. I am loving it. Just 2 suggestions. 1.A4 restriction (pls) - when I export all my notes into PDFs it becomes a disaster. Please make it with A4 restriction like notability and goodnotes 5. It will make it the best app for notetaking. 2. Include Draw shapes and lines feature on Android. I take my notes in S6 and it doesn't have those features in the list. It will be good if you add them. 3. Pointer - Actually Pointer in a notetaking app is so cool. Otherwise The app is 🔥🤩","Multiple interface and sync problems with this app. First of all, you can't select multiple notes at once to move them around/delete. The UI designer of this app must be some amature with no knowledge of it at all. Second of all, one of the notebooks suddenly stopped syncing at all and I can't see them anywhere on the web version of the app. Third of all, you can't move a whole section from one notebook to another. I mean, in what age are you living to not provide such a basic feature."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.microsoft.office.onenote","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.onenote&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"AppLock Pro - App Lock & Privacy Guard for Apps","description":"AppLock Pro is one of the most popular app locker that you can lock your apps or photos easily. \r\n\r\nChoose a lock model, lock apps you want.

As an amateur video editor who needs to screen record for my videos, this is incredibly annoying. Usually it's great, tho.","This app is really great, its sound quality and video quality is really very good.The thing I like most is that you can put a logo of your choice instead of the recorder logo, it's really great.","The random stopping time seems to be fjxed. A new bug I noticed is it will close by itself. I'll be looking for the red circle but it closed itself for some reason. Another minor bug is the audio will be distored when I start recording.

This was the last chance for this cleaner. I no longer recommend getting this cleaner. It works to the point of placing ads on your phone that you can not clear unless you turn off your phone and restart the phone.. I was using the free app but with this problem. I do not recommend paying for it eather. I am removing this app for good.","My experience both today and a good 95% of the previous times and indeed still now in the present, this very enjoyable app has & given me & I'm very sure it will continue to give me the same level of enjoyment for the foreseeable future, natureably I recommend this excellent security app to everyone if it is indeed the best security you are looking for ok. Do your best & prove me WRONG!!. This app deserves 10 gold stars.","great app that works to help keep your device clean and running smoothly.I have this app on all my devices n it is free and there are very little ads to deal with. would recommend anyone else download as well n use regularly. Update: I have recently bought the yearly subscription for the premium cleaning app and will be informing you of any and all concerns, problems, or good things about the app once I try it out. It was only $11.99 per year n that's for the cleaner app only. Pretty cheap!","Update: This app does NOT get five stars, because updating my apps via APK Pure prompts an obsolescence message. Every time I tap the button to delete \"obsolete\" APK, my apps get ruined! | AVG Cleaner got rid of junk files on my phone and freed up some space for me. Yet the app is missing one option that would make it complete: the ability to skip stopping background processes.

This release includes: improved reliability and minor bug fixes.","comments":["Absolutely HORRIBLE! When it was a free app it worked great on all my devices, so when they decided to take that away I moved to a paid premium program and now this thing either gives me no result, for items in my account, or it gives me wrong logins and wrong passwords. Totally unreliable, do not use this app if you are truly relying on it to get into your accounts as you will spend more time trying to get the correct information, then on your site and that's only if you don't get locked out.","Free with limitations, why have to choose between Desktop and Mobile? I've used lastpass before this, its now a pain to use across devices. Lastpass is a hit and miss experience , the pop up box only appears 50% of the time, and not always the correct suggestions, I frequently have to copy and paste the details, leaving a password trail. Great database for storing passwords, card details, documents etc, cost of the premium is acceptable but it needs to work more than 50% for me to commit.","I've been using LastPass premium user for years now but my Andriod experience has been worse and worse and is just becomming intolerably frustrating. Just doesn't work half the time so I'm often struggling to log in. I don't mind paying but the Android app needs some serious work, it needs to be functional. Just terrible right now. Apple version works much, much better.","Still love it...This app has got to be the most useful app I've ever used. I only have to remember one password. LastPass does the rest. It's as secure as you could ever hope to find. it can be set to auto-fill your username and p/w for websites and apps, as well as save secure notes, credit card profiles, software licenses and any other information you want to keep private. I've been using LastPass for 6-7yrs now, and I'll still be using it for another 6-7yrs. Try it. You'll like it.","Zero stars. Unusable garbage on Android. It keeps getting worse and worse. The LastPass service is excellent and works great on Windows and iOS but is utterly worthless on Android. If you actually figure out how to get the persistent notification, it will ask for your fingerprint then show the autofill but hides it before you can use it."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.lastpass.lpandroid","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lastpass.lpandroid&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"BasicNote - Notes, Notepad","description":"Basic Note is a simple notepad.\r\nThis app is a easy and fast notes app.","descriptionHTML":"Basic Note is a simple notepad.<br>This app is a easy and fast notes app.","summary":"Basic Note is a simple notepad.<br>This app is a easy and fast notes app.","installs":"1,000,000+","minInstalls":1000000,"maxInstalls":3810551,"score":4.8348117,"scoreText":"4.8","ratings":32088,"reviews":12112,"histogram":{"1":471,"2":137,"3":451,"4":2100,"5":28927},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$2.99 per item","size":"5.4M","androidVersion":"5.0","androidVersionText":"5.0 and up","developer":"Notas Notepad","developerId":"Notas+Notepad","developerEmail":"pravida19@naver.com","developerWebsite":"https://notasnotepad.blogspot.com","developerAddress":"17, Beobwon-ro 4-gil, Songpa-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea\n(zipcode:05855)","privacyPolicy":"https://blog.naver.com/pravida19/221369993869","developerInternalID":"5396966490519979613","genre":"Productivity","genreId":"PRODUCTIVITY","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xbAWjab6oSix3OI4jN2ydgUoNXKgxGfy92B_7FUUnPTqbixdTNC1aE5YhETC1HogigI","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/fewRb3xf4hA1VQ8taA1Gunok0ZK5u0zM1Zz9NUPCcg_ckoIqhg73WmI8jTshHH4ONV5J","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/tmUrxOZH_uMp4YFzDgJLl-NppdmV8FyeOCz7SyJfyiPlFiY2R57J6Phof_DmvQDe9yo","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-_6JVec-tMuh8wIuDdnDNZdSm2akdCPWxKznFxROLv45MKjZLrM_ETJNrQRRLElHwjk","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/r9tpZ9_uVIHFPYTocABoLLpr8Fa7_ceFRZoPW1_oZYse-tqQaOCyJ8JNK8JuF4lC4g","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/TZV_uO1EdULqDCZjqPb6SWMS7wroa4bati7BGUbw2hmbP3A5yWeyR0BgKK5LM_IhkJc","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Mz7_IhEhuCA--QZeZ5BgZxj8d15xsPzT0gVwDDM_A10C0dFbaa3OaXAVx8sU_gJKGps","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7j8MzjRkT4XiVSYG0ACb88dnlq6IjiFZcfqrqhAn8kacRs5ga7SRJq1Sv0pa80oHJg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/DH13TZWFIQiXTMj1OD9wsxXczJMQU_Jtl0rSwTpXZL7dmYygLiiM5xzvaP8PKI0PfQk"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Jul 29, 2019","updated":1616468802000,"version":"1.1.9","recentChanges":"#New : Dark Mode","comments":["I love this app very useful. I made a generic grocery list of most often purchased. I can uncheck when i need to pick up an item and check off when i purchased. Add new items or delete them as needed. Also saved list for various stores....home depot, walmart and such. I also use the note feature to create notes that I can reuse to send instuction to groups I am in. Quick and easy to use. Have had no issues with taking up too much space on my phone. I say its a keeper!!!!","Simple and easy to use and SO MUCH BETTER than the updated Samsung Notes. Easy to use to make lists, with an option to make them checklists (tap the item and it puts a line through it, but leaves it there so you can see what you checked off). Thank you, Samsung Notes! If your latest forced update hadn't made your Notes so complicated and intrusive I would never have found this app! This app keeps things simple & easy which is why someone uses Notes instead of a Word document in the first place.","Great app. Easy to use and I love all the features. I wish you could write things in bold, highlight, and choose what color you want the text to be in. I guess I'm asking for to much considering it's a free app. The name of the app is no deciver, it's a basic note app. It has checklists and normal notes, you can also put things into categories and name said categories. Overall, good app, no regrets.","You get what you ask for with this one here. I am currently writing a song, but am totally unorganised when it comes to notes and stuff like that, which this helps with a ton. A few features would be cool like bold letters, or highlighting, but im just being picky. Nice straight forward app.","Great app, I love it a lot. It's really easy to use and the only adds I have had so far are the pop up one's. Other than that it is amazing.

I would also like the ability to save completed forms directly from the app as a \"save as\" rather than erasing and rewriting over and over on the same master copy after saving in a separate program.","Why is there no \"save\" button/option? Why when sending off the file, it says, file saved, but when file received and opened, only a signature is visible and all content and text entered from sender is missing? Adobe? You're a mega million (or more) company just taking people's money and putting out shxtty programs and apps, not resolving concerns and issues your paying customers are expressing to you.

I enjoy you can both see you completed and still not tasks on one page. However, the app's widget started to lag quite often what is annoying. It get stuck when you try to add first tasks for the day and tasks' suggesting scroll-up ribbon start to hover and there is no other way to stop except from exit. Also smt the widget doesn't show tasks at all in a window. Please, fix it!!!Lowered stars as issue not solved","Pros: complete a repeat task & a copy of that task is created at the time interval specified; easy-to-use widget; sort by date or priority; different color themes; & ability to share lists by email or text (recipient doesn't need a Microsoft account). Cons: time interval for months & years do not allow for day-of-the-week repeat (for the date, not the first Saturday). Easy work-around is to repeat by week (52 weeks for a year).","Would be really great if it remembered the reminders I didn't do the previous day, instead of asking me to re-add them to the list for the current day (there may be a setting for it, but I haven't found it) Also it's quite annoying that I can complete repetitive tasks like taking meds for days that are still to come, and now I've forgotten to take my meds, because I accidentally completed the take last week when I was clearing out other completed tasks","This app sucks! So sorry but it deletes notes, duplicates subtasks etc, its very annoying! Not good for professional use. Update: Months later, the issue that subtasks dont synchronize is not fixed. Thats quite embarassing. And makes the app super tedious - its free though, so cant compain. Can't sign in, screen stays white... You have got to be kidding me - OK, works over mobile data, not over wifi weirdly. Dear Microsoft Team, Please fix the issue, that subtasks are not synchronized. It literally makes the entire app close to useless to me, since I keep my important notes in subtasks, and can not see them on my Mac, if I add them on my phone. Please maybe also hire me so I can write some tests so issues like this dont happen. I can work remotely from Germany. Thank you. Best, Jan","For students it is not much good app but good for doing a personal business it is very good as it has tasks, my date, important, planned, assigned to me, Flagged email you can also schedule timing, and remind me of sun is also. I think it is better app to remember you what you want to do. For Students are recommend you student calendar."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.microsoft.todos","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.todos&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Microsoft PowerPoint: Slideshows and Presentations","description":"Microsoft PowerPoint presents you with a presentation and slides app that you can carry with you wherever you go.\r\n\r\nThe PowerPoint app gives you access to the familiar tool you know and love.

Stack has just launched so please send us feedback on what can be improved.","comments":["Very good app! I hope someday this can be used for official government ID. one little thing I just had trouble with is that it doesn't seem intuitive to move things between stacks. I added a document and it was in no stacks. I couldn't add it to one without downloading the PDF and sharing it to the app again, even though it already has a copy of it. minor thing but worth pointing out. I will still use this app heavily. I want to get copies of all my important documents in here.","I love everything Google; it's sync/accessibility/etc is a lifesaver. I would love a scanner app that also doubles as an organizer. While this app is off to a good start in that direction, it's still lacking features that prevent me from fully commiting to using it at the moment. The concept of organizing scanned items into folders is a huge asset for this app! However, the app NEEDS to allow the user to be able to sort said items by name/date. The sooner this function arrives, the better!!","Simple, easy to use and intuitive. Automatic backup to Drive is especially helpful. One of my favorite features is the ability to save a document to more than one stack. Unfortunately it looks like stack selection can only be made when creating a new document. I don't see an option to update which stack(s) the document is linked to after initial creation. Great job!","This app is great! One major bug that keeps it from being 5-star is that the adjustable \"color\" feature rarely keeps my manual selection. Generally, after making all my edits, the preview looks as intended. When I hit save the edited version is overridden by the original photo when the PDF is generated. Automatic color editing options are great, and I often want to use the medium and bright options. Happy to work with your team to troubleshoot. More sort options (Title A-Z) in app would be nice","I love this app. I'm documenting all of my purchases, with pics of serial numbers and receipts. They save in Google Drive as a PDF as well, so don't have to only use the app to view it. Google, please don't kill this one! One thing I'd like to see is the ability to change the order of the pics in the edit window. You can delete individual pics, but can't move one from the back to the front without deleting them all and adding them all back in a different order."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.area120.paperwork","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.area120.paperwork&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Mobile Security: VPN Proxy & Anti Theft Safe WiFi","description":"McAfee Mobile Security is the ultimate mobile security tool.

The adds aren't even annoying, they don't cover the while screen and are very manageable. There's also different ways to lock apps. For example, you can set it to say that the app crashes instead of showing the show finger print/password thing. Overall, this isn't just an excellent security app, its an essential app.","Amazing, just one suggestion. When you hide the app by disguising it as a calculator, could you make it act like a calculator unless you do something special? It's pretty suspicious having two calculators. Lovely app, love all the security measures as well.","The only issue with this app that I have is the simple fact that half the time I open the one app I need protected, sometimes it's just not protected at all.

The app charges 25 cents per message/photo, each requiring approval before being available for the inmate to see. There are no guidelines listed explaining what's acceptable/not acceptable. If the message/picture isn't approved, there's no credit applied to the account. I sent my husband four pictures of his Chevelle, all were approved. Then, I sent a picture of the engine in that Chevelle, and it was declined. I sent the EXACT SAME picture again, they approved it. sigh","I have this installed on both an iPhone and droid. It is a great app when it works and I'm very thankful to have it available. . About a week ago, a forced update began causing the app not to work properly. Messages cannot be input or sent, but they can be read if you close the app and open it again. The photo icons aren't clickable either, however this will be a great feature when it's working again. The 'visit now' connects just fine and really appreciate that! If a developer, by any chance, is reading this review, I hope you're able to fix the last update so the app works again for messages and photos. If I can install an older version without a forced update, please let me know that work-around.","I dropped 60$ into this and have not gotten to use a cent.

My very first task is a fail and the app will be deleted. I need a daily reminder every WEEKDAY, not every single day. This app doesn't seem to offer that, at least not easily. I need an app that it intuitive and efficient, and this simply isn't it. Too bad, I had high hopes. I can't say much about an app that lasted all of a few minutes, but I doubt that I'm alone in needing to list repetitive tasks that follow a routine","I paid for the premium version and I'm deleting this app. I wrote many times to the app makers but never had a reply. I sent them lots of screenshots. This app is too buggy and feels unstable. The last straw was one of my repeat To Do's with sub categories has turned into 10 subcategories that say 'car wash', and all my other subcategories have now gone. It's infuriating. You can't charge for a premium service for something so buggy. Not happy at all.","The app is somewhat neat and elegant. Not overloaded, which is good in the world of \"todo apps\". However. The first sin is the \"add task\" notification, which is a common task apps abuse. Notifications are for notifying. With this thing on you'll never have this \"done clearing notifications\" feeling again (and isn't regaining control over things to do the purpose of every todo app?). (Yes, you CAN turn it off.) Second sin is that the category color isn't used anywhere, so it's basically useless.","(Updated from 3 stars): Stunning and optimised 👍 I would highly recommend it In terms of task ordering, is there a way of getting them to appear in order from top to bottom rather than bottom to top? Previous problem (which I awarded 3 stars for, now fixed): 1/6 chance the 'press and hold to reorder task' feature would work ie: Display the border surrounding the task and allow me to move the task. This wasted lots of time.","I understand having ads but I have been trying to adjust something and every time I click its like there is an ad. I used a list and sublist and it seemed to copy the first item all the way down the list. I'm finding a new app. When I first used the app I enjoyed it. The ads weren't as often."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"todolist.scheduleplanner.dailyplanner.todo.reminders","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=todolist.scheduleplanner.dailyplanner.todo.reminders&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Phone Clean - Super Cleaner, Booster","description":"Phone Clean is a powerful phone cleaner.

Even the loading is short and u don't have to confirm many times if we want to save the PDF or not. It's working perfectly fine for me.

The problem I have with it is the app has to be running for it to work. It doesn't run in the background and I tried to enable \"Accessibility Service\" permissions to but it won't let me. If you make it to where it runs in background and I can use gestures without opening app first. 5 star app.","having to use an old phone with no build-in flashlight, this one is great. turns on right when I launch it, and I've had no issues. no intrusive ads, annoying crashes, nothing. good job 👍","This flashlight has never failed and i LOVE LOVE LOVE not being interrupted by ads. And i don't have to worry about moments of dimmness 😂😂 The app is very convenient to have. I am disabled and i use it to help reading certain colors in articles and at night with moving around my home. It is also great to have when walking at night ,bc i use crutches and really need to see where i am stepping. Forgive me for not thinking to add these things the first time. Thank you for this app!!","A bit complicated to use; requiring a few steps to engage.

I am a mom of four, starting my own business and this app makes things easier. I love organization, details and schedules! This app is all that and more. I didn't purchase the upgrade for a couple months and would've been happy, however it was worth the purchase to have my children schedules, my schedule and all their school activites as well as family and friends birthdays and events so easily trackable!!! Amazing, I would recommend!!💜💜","I use this app solely for recipes and meal planning. It is super easy to save recipes that I find on line. It is also very easy to edit records. The improvements that I would like to see are 1) Being able to make folders so I can easily find recipes for Holidays, soups, vegetarian dishes, etc. 2) Be able to delete an individual item from the calendar, instead of all or nothing. 3) Be able to add recipes to a calendar where you can see what else is on there for the day.","Great app overall. 3 stars due to a simple yet absent feature: the ability to quickly reorder lists - alphabetising, for example. This would quickly eliminate the issue with duplicate items/having to scroll through the list, over and over, saving much time and frustration. This really should have been introduced along side the ability to make lists in the first place. 5/5 for everything else.","App is not connecting on my computer, says its not connecting because of internet issues. So I uninstalled it and now it is gone. I need this, I depend on this calendar. In the 3 years I have had it. I NEVER had any issues. I don't want to log into it every time I go to the browser. I need the app PLEASE.","Currently not connecting to the internet on my computer. All other apps that need the internet are not having a problem connecting.

App won't move to adoptable storage and I definitely don't have room to store email internally. Looked promising otherwise and such a simple thing spoils it. This is so easy and no reason not to do so. With modern fast SD the speed penalty is usually not noticable. Yes, many apps are guilty of the same thing, that doesn't make it right. The only way I can make space on my device is to delete other apps I use also guilty of this. Not one more!","Many parts are cool in theory, but the flaws far outshine the positive aspects. Here are some of the major issues: 》You can create folders for organizing your inbox, but cannot set any rules for how items get sorted into said folders 》Folders other than your main inbox do not refresh, show unread #, or show search results 》About 10% of the time, the app will randomly start reading my emails allowed. Closing the app in multitasking doesn't stop it & it's not my device settings. Full dealbreaker.","This is a nice email app, my favorite in fact, but it has one flaw that I've noticed. When using a VPN connection, a sent email is reported as successfully sent, but the email is not sent and will later be found in the Outbox. This has caused me problems and financial loss a few times. There should really be a 'failed' message if the email fails to send, regardless of the cause. Because of this flaw, I can no longer trust this as my primary email app.","This is the best email app I've found. Others I've tried have responded very sloooooowly, stopped syncing after reaching a certain # of emails, frozen & become non-responsive, . . . This app is fast and makes it easy to categorize emails & block junk email. It also offers an Assistant feature with a lot of handy tools. Glad I found it.","This program works very well. I've always had a preference to keep the in-boxes separate, and this combines them as a default but I've grown to like that. Teo taps and you can separate them anyway. Having them together makes searching much easier if you use several email accounts and aren't always sure which email you have used for any specific account. Search fu cation is very quick either way.

I've used it for years for personal use. the only reason I'm giving less than 5 stars is because when I close the app it kicks off my screensaver and leaves a message about not using it for work use... I use it for personal use to access my home PC when I need something that's there and nothing else. I wish there was a way to disable that notification.","Keeps thinking I'm using for business rather than personal on some of my devices (latest being my ipad). You have to fill a form and send to them and wait weeks for a response to get yourself cleared. Very inconvenient. They don't have an affordable personal plan to avoid this either. The false flagging makes TeamViewer unusable when this happens. Too bad because it works great when it works.","With the exception of the difficulty to resize windows by the edges (because my tablet lacks a mouse), this is incredible. I've started using TeamViewer's multiple implementations to administrate my whole home network. It's beautiful, and the fact I can even do it from my tablet is just nuts!","I prefer TeamViewer over EVERY remote management tool for my personal use. It makes me the favorite son because M&D know I'm just a click away from being able to help them conquer their technological difficulties. I recommend this software to previous businesses I have worked for because it allows use over SmartPhones and PCs alike without sacrificing features. I use an LG Wing 5G SmartPhone so I'm able to see a whole desktop screen on the top and a keyboard on the Swivel screen which is BADASS!","ve been restricted due to \"commercial use\". ive used TV for about 5yrs and all i do is occasionally login to my desktop pc to check my game is still running yet somehow im considered commercial?? anyways, i followed their link to fill out a form to ask them to review my account.

Whenever I make a PDF with a file name containing characters such as comma and full stop, the scanner replaces those characters with an underscore _ .

My boss spent a long time on the phone with customer support and still got nowhere. And, after setting up fingerprint lock to log in, then having my phone's fingerprint sensor malfunction, the app did not allow me the option of logging in with my password. Needless to say, we quit using it after a month, and the information on the notes is lost forever. Intuit blows","New QuickBooks GPS tracking is extremely inaccurate & faulty compared to the previous TSheets version. \"Notes\" is a good feature but items written in this section, even after saving, will disappear. Have also had many occasions where Notes that were successfully saved disappeared 3-4 days later. Did not have these issues with TSheets. \"Take a Break\" is inconveniently placed & when accidentally started there is no way to stop it until the 30 minutes are up.","Works pretty well but make sure that you have your notes filled in or it won't clock you out. I wish there was an audible alarm when this happens because it's easy to not notice when you are busy and find out hours later you are still on the clock. also, if I add notes immediately upon signing in they don't always get saved.","I was a Tshhets customer before the sold to Intuit and integrated it into QBO. I used to love this app. Ever since giving it over to Intuit, it is absolutely disfuctional. The mobile. app doesn't even let you log in. The Web app constantly logs you out then mixes up it's log in with QBO. I have to try log in 2-3 times before it goes to tsheets. Yesterday I had to log back in 6 times, essentially everytime I need to log out of a client for break or switch clients, I get kicked all the way out.","Terrible app. First two days using it after adding my hours and fixing them because I kept finding the hours changed and the block system it uses to be confusing.

They just give you a complaint number never work over that complaint. Now iam going to do mnp in jio","I am not able use this app. It's show bug and stopped.

Implement an automated query section or digital assistant for efficient resolution of problems.","Pretty much useless app. I have a year long unlimited plan but my recharge is not reflecting in the transaction history.

Sadly it's the only thing available in our new area. Somehow cox gigablast doesn't last the whole month and adds extra fees to keep the fast connection but when we had CenturyLink it lasted all month and we had more laptops and phones connected. The panoramic keeps disconnected from our TVs and I have to restart the whole modem at least twice a week. This service is a joke and to make matters worst its more expensive than CenturyLink. I got my money's work with CL. Cox sucks!","Pay for extra Speed never get as much as i pay for service is constantly either out or running slow kicking me from my games or effecting my streaming just seems like they really need to follow the lead of comcast and update all there connections and offer there services at a reasonable price what we pay at cox is double what they would charge and only half as good being a internet and cable tyrant can only last so long care for your customers not destroy there faith in ya.","VERY HELPFUL especially if you have kids. Would have gave 4.5 Stars. Not 5 because sometimes (Rarely) it doesnt seem to register when you change cutoff times or struggles to load up period. I do recommend!","For the past several nights, you get 1 star, I have gigablast and every night between 10 pm & midnight, the net slows down to almost nothing, download speed, at 1.16 mb. upload speed, at almost, NOTHING, BAD FOR HOME ALARM SYSYEM, Been customer for to long.","Service is constantly going out.

I can't make the alarm ring no matter what. I've tried all the battery, access, whatever options and it still doesn't work. MIUI seems to be full of bugs. I'll give you a good rating because the app is actually very good and easy to use.","I am using the free version 5.2.9 as a calendar only. It is simple and efficient with all the basic features. Good to know that there is a upgrade posibility if my requirements should increase in future. I also enabled CALDAV synchronization through a provider/server. Very happy with fast and precise answers from support. Hope it will stay like this. Thank you.","Backup feature is excellent, and exactly what i was looking for in a Calendar! Price for full service is excellent. Holidays are missing: Halloween, Easter, St Patrick's Day, and maybe others. Please add all Holidays. I will make it a 5 star rating once you add all the missing Holidays.","I LOST EVERYTHING! I have used this app for a while now and have loved it. I use this app to balance my work, I am starting a new business and I use this app to organise my bookings. I decided to upgrade to the pro version because I use this app a lot. Then I lost all of my bookings and appointments! I am completely screwed! Please help me get my bookings back and I will remove this review. I have also emailed about this problem and not yet got a response.","Works great, but... I seem to be unable to delete events in the calendar, which causes me many issues.

Since day 1, it was started 3 days back and am start facing issues with internet and set-up box too, already logged the complainant and no one visited to check the issue, even i called the engenier and salesman too they never pick up my calls. I will definitely escalate this issue to social media now and need to disconnect my connection immediately.","Pathetically slow internet. Evertime i try the trouble shoot option it tells me to use internet at some other location or at another time as too many users are using the internet at the same time. If JIO does not have the capacity to provide 4g speeds to existing users it should stop enrolling new users as it only degrades the quality further. Stopped using one jio connection and changed backfrom postpaid to prepaid on other due to slow speeds.","This is the worst app I have ever used !! Everytime I recharge, it shows as upcoming plan and I cannot activate it ! Contacted their chat support and I was asked to click on the 'Activate Plan' button but even after the latest udpate, there is no such button at all ! I am so frustrated and disappointed as I am using this network for work from home and it is affecting my productivity. Will never recommend it to anyone ! I had mentioned that I already contacted chat support. Couldn't resolve !","Wish I could give 0 freaking star. I already have 7 months of plan left but out of nowhere it showed my plan expired. I restarted my phone, reinstalled the app, called 1991 and all but nothing changed. And then I recharged thinking I may have miscalculated and then I woke up and checked again. It was all there. Now I have 2 years worth of plan..and wasted money that I could have used somewhere else for now. Freaking useless.","Very bad service, I have recharged 2399rupess for one year. I am facing jio network issue problem since 02 days I have compliant to customer care service,but no anyone have solved my problem.

The app is useful but I will still looking for a replacement app until the issue is fixed.","Honestly, this app was very decent at the beginning and it gave me lots of options but recently it's saying \"No available image\" and when I go to update it, nothing happens. They told me to put it on something with a battery usage so it would stop and when I did so, it still continued. Please fix this issue soon cause I really like this app!!","It's exactly what I needed: adds the ability to put widgets with (or without) slideshows on your homescreen, and allowed me to set it to launch the photos app of my choice when I on it.

Found myself scrolling an app without even realizing I did it. It worked for awhile until I realized the SIMPLE workaround that does not even require me to close app.I guess this would work well for my kid, which is why I am giving it 3 stars. As a personal app for Blocking I give it 1 star. It doesn't Block anything, it just slows down access by 5 seconds, max.","It would be great if it actually blocked the site. The site will still populate and then you'll see a page overlapping it stating block site blocked it and you have to click out of that to go back to continue your search. Happens at least 5 times a day and I don't search the web that much. It's still very annoying just as much if not more than the site I want to block. Seems to defeat the purpose. Uninstalled.","This app is good but then there is only 1 issue that needs to be solved. I'm a premium user and I downloaded this app to curb certain addictions of mine. The only reason I went premium is because I felt like the uninstall feature would help me stay accountable. I soon realised I was wrong after the purchase because even if you turn on the uninstall feature, you can simply turn it off with 1 click and then uninstall the app. This need to be fixed. If you do fix it, I will reconsider my review.","I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!! It's says free, you download, it it let's you block 1. After one you have to upgrade, you don't even get any comfort or peace of mind on knowing that this is actually doing the job before it says you need to upgrade to block anyone else.","Used to be the best but now after installing it on a new phone, it wants me to accept its spyware on my phone (\"to keep track of my usage stats so I'll know how I use my phone\". Thanks but no thanks - as if you ever needed that to block specific apps/sites) or it won't let me use it. Also, every other feature is now behind a paywall except you can only block 10 or so sites/apps. That's all it does now. It's become useless.

Chat sent to support takes 20+ minutes to respond, if at all. If you leave the app you will not be notified of responses and they will close the ticket if you do not respond in 2-3 minutes, removing any convenience. Thankfully not a customer anymore and my heart goes out to those in their service area","Service sucks everything installed new net goes out every time it rains . We have had an abnormal wet summer. Since may it has gone out 58 times. Their customer service can't do any thing. Their technicians try to charge you because everything thing looks okay on a dry day all my neighbors complain their services do the same. And we can't go anywhere else because their isn't another provider In this neighborhood. So they got me! just a rant wont get fixed more of something to do while its down","Worst service!!! Bill changes prices. Haven't had phone service for 4 months which is suppose to be included in my package, but still in paying for it. Never signed up for a 2 year contract, but that's what they say I have. Service shuts down for maintenance, but you still pay for service. Customer Service is rude.","App seems okay. Service is pretty bad though. For the past couple years my internet will just randomly turn off and back on. sometimes it can be just for a split second other several minutes and it does it all day.

My biggest gripe is that I wish there was a way to be able to only connect to one device at a time. I use a Bluetooth receiver to watch TV. If I leave my phone Bluetooth on and that TV Bluetooth on, my headset will connect to 2 devices at a time, which causes audio/functionality issues on my phone. Have a feature on Jabra Sound+ to only allow ear buds to connect to 1 device at a time would be nice. Great app nonetheless 👏","I'm not exaggerating, I've purchased and returned every competitor to the elite 85t. Hands down their sound quality, and this app make them the best earbuds period. Love the equalizer, ear audio tests and quick modes. Very decent noise cancellation and the physical click buttons are great!! No accidental touches (yeah!). Can't wait to see what they do with the next generation!","The app takes a minute to catch up to the headphones connecting via Bluetooth. And when I disconnect the headphones, the app continues to show in my notifications, saying it's \"searching for Jabra.\" It's not terribly inconvenient, just annoying. Otherwise, the app does what I need it to do.","The app doesn't connect and show notifications reliably. More than half of my usage I don't have the controls in the notification shade. It also regularly hangs when trying to store the last known location of my earbuds. The hardware is nice and works as expected, but the companion app is only marginally effective.","Great app, really enjoy the personalization of the button configuration, but resets each time I unpair the headset and does not save my preferences. I have literally had to manually add hearthrough for triple press over a 1000 times. Make it so the reconfigurations are constant and saved even when turning the headset off and it will be the best available on market.

I've been getting that message for the last 2 days. Too bad I will not be prorated nor refunded for the service I am paying for but yet not able to use. If this becomes the norm, I will unfortunately have to cancel service. Too bad because the concept is there but execution sucks.","The app works sometimes and when it does I love it. Unfortunately most days it stops working. I have to try to start my car 3 and 4 times before it actually takes and that's if it lets me log in. I live in extreme heat and bought this feature so that I could cool down my car from the 120 degree heat outside. I've been paying for this service for years only to be able to actually use it maybe a 1/4 of the time. I've never been able to turn on the cooled seats or see anything else but if my car is on. If this app actually worked as intended, it would be worth 5 stars but seeing how I pay monthly for a service that rarely works, I'm giving a generous 2 stars. Please fix bugs and connectivity issues. In addition to this, after writing this review, the blue link app now stopped working entirely and is claiming to be experiencing a sever outage. This outage seems to be going on now for over 24 hours. I really don't see the point in paying for this app if it does not work 90% of the time. I will be cancelling this app very soon if it does not improve. The only option I use is the remote car start since I live in the desert. With that no longer working, I could just go get a remote installed from the local car audio guys.","When the app works, it is amazing...but they always seem to have system outages....the last one lasting 2 days. Bluelink knows about it but will not offer compensation. I am paying for a service that I cannot use. Not right on customer service. Calling customer care does not help either.","Wish it did more... Like allowing both defrosters to run and side mirrors to heat in the winter, and maybe open / close windows. Also, wish you could set the time it stays unlocked when remote unlocking. It's super short before relocking. Occasionally remote start just doesn't work even though all the conditions are met. Not sure why. Finally, the speed and convenience of a key fob remote start are still missed. I'd take this over the fob, but both would be much nicer.","Update: terrible experience registering and enrolling. Have been on the phone an hour with representative. Website is slow and not responding. Still not completed with all of their website issues. I would give it 0 Stars. Poor experience setting up Blue Link.

I hate that stupid orange little bar over to the side on my phone all of the time!!! I have even uninstalled some apps because of it!! Fix it!!!!","Will not work on some androids! This app installs in accessibility, not a good place for anything but true handicap features. Problem: acc'.apps must override battery savers. My Alcatel has factory Smart Manager battery saver that can't be turned off so this app was usually off. After 2 years and 6+ sessions McAfee-No clue.

A Huge invitation for vulnerability.","downloaded the mcafee app seemed to work except it kept telling me to creat a profile for the identity theft protection but everytime i tried it always said were working on this feature try again later..so last night i uninstalled it and re installed it now it keeps saying my subscription is expired...i pay $60. a month through metro my subscripsion is free!! and also wants a 6 digit pin?? when i click on forgot pin it says it dosent recognise my phone # or email address!! what a joke....","Can't get past it trying to verify me as a Metro customer. I get an error saying something went wrong and to try later. I have uninstalled and downloaded again 3 times and STILL can't get the app to work.

I love that I can see each of my calendars individually, or all at once! Two suggestions for improvement would be to constantly update events from imported calendars on other apps and to have a way to customize an overview calendar with some, but not all, of one's calendars from within this app. As an example, I would like to see each of my children's calendars at the same time, but not my dinner plans calendar.","My husband and I find this app super helpful in staying on top of everything. But the current day of the week is very hard to find visually. It is highlighted but very very lightly. So at a glance you can't immediately find what day you are in. It would be nice for the current day if the week to be highlighted darker or maybe in a bright color. We have even considered switching calendars because this is so difficult for my husband.","My family and I love this app but recently they have taken away the widgets for the home screen and that has really made it a bit less user friendly. Hoping the next update brings back the widgets so we can fill one of our home screens full of the calendar.","Really love this app, my roommates and I got it to coordinate our work schedules and plans since we are a mixed andriod and apple user household. My only improvement would be a way for my to link this app with my Google calander the same way the apple users can (as I see the option to link apple account for it but it's no use to me with an android) so I don't have to update both my phone calendar and timetree calendar when I get my work rota.","Verry good, I've had this for about a month and it's simple and easy to use, meaning all my family members find it straightforward to understand. Its verry customisable with colours and labels. There are ads on the vertion I use but they arent invasive, they just kind of sit there without pop ups/noise so they are okay"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"works.jubilee.timetree","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=works.jubilee.timetree&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"VPN Unlimited - Free VPN Proxy Shield","description":"KeepSolid VPN Unlimited – The Best 🏆 Private & Secure VPN app for Android!\r\n\r\nConnect to one of our VPN proxy servers:\r\n🔹 Obtain fast access to any geo-blocked content \r\n🔹 Unblock video streaming websites \r\n🔹 Protect yourself on public WiFi hotspot \r\n🔹 Get turbo speed\r\n\r\nFrom now on, VPN Unlimited becomes a part of our brand new security bundle MonoDefense.

But sometimes it doesn't connect to the location you wanted. rather it shows you that it has connected but didn't actually connect... But still the must reliable VPN connection 😅😁😁😁","I just downloaded and set it up in less that two minutes. So far, it has THE BEST available connections AND speed I've experienced with a VPN, by far!! I do not have any income right now (Covid related) but I am already trying to figure out a way to purchase. It's THAT GOOD!! ☮️💪🏻💜","Occasionally gets blocked by streaming services but they usually fix it quickly and you can just pop into another server when that one doesn't work. Definitely worth getting the lifetime subscription. I have very rarely run into speed issues.","Very fast and stable VPN.

Loud is very important for me since I'm an extremely deep sleeper with my narcolepsy. The loud ringtones, & the Random option, are great. Very rarely an alarm won't show up in my notification bar & won't go off. I'm not sure why but it does not happen very often. Although I do not like the newer message screen after you shut off an alarm. Sometimes if I'm in a hurry it's just an unnecessary extra step I have to wait on & deal with.","Most the time this is just a perfect app but i don't know exactly why but sometimes the alarm goes of for only a split second and then is off Edit: the update removed the cool graph feature to look when you have woken up and how it changed over time, i REALLY want it back, else i need to find a way to extract the dates into my own graph...","Love it! This alarm allows me to wake up to my favorite song through my Bluetooth earbuds. Exactly what I was looking for! The only thing I hate is the monthly subscription.

However, BitWarden now blows away 1Password, Dashlane, Keeper, etc. in all areas like price, option to self host, ease of use across all platforms. It worked better all the way from me using Firefox on Linux to family members on iOS and everything in between. Check reviews, someone is being paid, every site BW has highest user ratings yet other product gets editor choice?","After trying many different password managers I can confidently say this is the best one. It's just so nice not having some big company that just wants to maximize profits in control of my password data base. Not extra bulk, just what I need. Free version is sufficient but I happily pay to support this effort","Another (as someone else put it) \"Lastpass Refugee\" here. Phenomenal password manager. My only real complaint (and it truly is a very minor inconvenience) is that when I login to an app 99% of the time, I have to select the login from the BW login screen, I don't get the autofill popup over the app. I have tried various \"display on top\" settings in the app and permissions on my phone, and it will work sometimes, but never consistently and only rarely.","[EDIT : bugs and crash too much when login to an app] [EDIT : there is still bugs with the Android app they take too long to fix - one of them being an annoying pop-up covering other stuffs, or just not disappearing when it should - or fingerprint not working 1\\2 times - it still a good service but the app itself could be better]... Looking for a password manager? Don't go any further. Huge load of features for free and it's open source. One of the best out there","Why do I only get one attempt at biometrics unlock on android? This is the only app that gives me just one attempt. My slightly older phone with a glass screen protector isn't the most reliable at under-screen fingerprint scans. So I have to then click on and input a pin at least half the time. Slows me down and is completely unnecessary. Please fix that. As well as on some sites, the password is inputted into the wrong field, namely Amazon Smile and sites with more than one login page."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.x8bit.bitwarden","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.x8bit.bitwarden&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"iTranslate Translator & Dictionary","description":"iTranslate is the leading free translator / traductor and dictionary app. Easily translate text or start voice-to-voice conversations in over 100 languages.

I'm using offline translation, Spanish to English.

The way the tasks show up is very difficult to see and read at a glance, and the font in most places is so small it's not even readable.

I value privacy more than cross-platform. - 1 star for upgrade requiring yearly payments.

As in good integration with other apps and intuitive. But, the deal breaker for me as mentioned by others was the nagging to get you to upgrade to premium subscription. Yaaa, No! Uninstalled.

As long as this alarm doesn't change, I see no reason to ever try another. Yes it's basic, but that's what so many people want. Easy to programme and reliable - unlike so many other alarms that start of well but don't their performance deteriorates over time. Would be nice to have the option to customize, but no great loss really. The only thing that would make me uninstall would be if there were an increase in ads. Thankfully, it's ok at the moment. Thanks 👍","I like this alarm but there are times where it inexplicably doesn't work. It's easy to set, and easy to add new alarms, easy to delete alarms. You can easily choose what you want to have as your wake-up sound and how long you want it to play. It has been helpful but there have been mornings when I thought I slept through the alarm and the case was that the alarm didn't go off. This morning I was awake before the alarm went off, and so was able to watch as it gave me precisely one second of music/alarm, then the tablet went to the lock screen, no more alarm. I have it set to play for five minutes...correction: I HAD it set to play for five minutes. This morning I checked the settings and it says one minute; and it only played for one second. I have no idea why it changed from five to one minute or why it only played for one second and then the tablet went to the lock screen. For that reason the app gets three stars. It's not reliable. When it works it's great. But when it doesn't it could really screw up your day.","I like this alarm. It works well and is easy to operate. It's easy to schedule an alarm, alter that time, add additional alarms, alter the snooze time and vary methods to turn off the alarm. A scheduled alarm can be turned off (say for a particular day) and can simply be turned on again with just one tap. My only CRITICISM is the sound choices for the alarm. I'd like a nice soothing alarm, non jarring option & easier to add different ringtones.","It doesn't always operate the same way. Sometimes the buttons appear over my unlock code, sometimes I have to unlock first. Sometimes i can snooze with the power button, sometimes it doesn't work.

And if you loose that device, you can't restore your account again","I love this app!! It's easy to use and not too complicated. It's simply what I was looking for. It would have been even better if there was a feature in which we can customise our forest. Like for example move the plants to where we prefer and design the forest accordingly our preference.

Remote starting hasn't worked for a while but I'm guessing may be a problem with info/nav system in my K5. That thing is completely screwed up and the service departments at two Kia dealerships seem clueless. Not just about the info/nav system, but about everything to do with this car. Traded in a Mercedes E-class. The Kia K5 is actually a better car in a lot of ways, but the service departments are miles behind Mercedes.","The worst part is when it tells you vehicle status and something is wrong and you take it to the dealer and there's nothing wrong . 360 view. Does not work. They tell you to stick a pin in it. Restart your modem in your brand new car. Crazy will not pay for this. Really Dear Jeff I am following up with you regarding your inquiry for the 360 View being unable to be seen on the app. At this time, the functionality has been moved to the website only on the Kia Owner's Portal. I do see that","It works, except on wear os as this is also advertised to work on. Just the smartphone version works. This app works as planned, only has trouble saving settings one out of every 50 times. The app is plain, no dark mode as there are also no widgets. I would love to have a batter widget for my EV but you can check the battery level of the vehicle in app. The app remote start works well as does the remote lock. It saves the location of where your vehicle is at and it will also show you some charging stations on a map for you to find with the details if the the stations are occupied or not. If they can make the wear os app so you can at least have the basic remote features to lock/unlock, climate control, and check battery status on the watch itself. Then this app would get a 5 star. Other than that the app is okay.","Not to bad. It sure beats having to walk long ways to lock your vehicle doors when you forget to do it. When its cold i dont have to freeze for 15 mins waiting for engine to warm up for heat. If i could change anything i would like to be able to control more features like seat warmers and steering warmerd in the winter. All in all its a good app.","Pretty good but the 360° camera view doesn't display the captured photos on Android, and setting up favorite destinations and uploading to the car's nav system doesn't seem to work. Fix those two issues and I will revise my rating.

Worst of all is the popup window structure for opening projects in the web interface. There is NO AUTO SAVE! If you click off the project or task popup you lose everything you've entered. Saving is a bear. Sometimes it is an arrow. Sometimes it's a save button. Entering an alarm is an absurdly elaborate process. Ordering tasks is possible in the app; it's not possible in the web interface. The app has been out for years. I am shocked these issues have not been addressed.","Widget options are very minimal. Doesn't allow pulling in calendar events, so you'll still need to manage those obligations in another app. Subtasks on recurring tasks behave in a disconnected way in that you have to set up their recurrence separately and it can easily get out of sync. Date/recurrence input is unintuitive.","Was pleasantly surprised with nice UI and ability to add and organize tasks. Got everything moved over from G Tasks and set to use Todoist. That was until I was waiting for a reminder to notify me a task is due. A notification of a task due is an integral part of task management. Unfortunately you must purchase the premium version for this to work, which in my opinion makes this app completely unusable.","Just right. It's not crowded with unnecessary features. Which I really like. I know a task manager app is very easy to create so devs usually end up adding too much features just because. A good example is ClickUp. Either way I like it 😉","App used to be good, used it for chores and household tasks. Now the Today page no longer shows which Project and/or Section a task is listed under (I have a Cleaning project with Sections for each room). So now I have two \"Clean sink\" tasks in my Today page, and I wouldn't know which two sinks it's referring to. Master bathroom sink? Guest bathroom sink? Kitchen sink?

Previously the app was a little annoying at times with screens reloading a few seconds after initially loading so you ended up clicking on the wrong devices to block/unblock. Now, I'm just presented with a list of 100s of devices - most are no longer active due to the way Android randomizes MAC addresses. These don't show up on the web version and so I'm left with a horrible user experience of having to delete each one - one at a time in the app. After investing lots of time and money in getting my Orbi system setup to a reasonable working system, it's just awful that this is ruined by an update I didn't need/want.","DO NOT CLICK THE PAUSE BUTTON. I did so yesterday and discovered that the pause button in the Device Manager \"pauses\" you connection to the Internet. The internal network functions but the outside world might as well no longer exist. And guess what? There is simply no way to UNPAUSE. I looked through every panel in the web interface; nothing there. The app itself -- once you've \"paused\" the Internet -- errors out when trying to go to Device Manager. I spent an hour trying to figure out how to unpause and finally gave up. I finally had to do a hard factory reset and manually reconfigure all my custom settings. Pause is an idiotic \"feature\" that gives no warning that you're about to completely knock yourself offline and gives you no functional way to unpause. I'm also annoyed that upon setting up my network again from scratch, the Orbi app automatically signed me up for the Armor service, which I've specifically NOT signed up for ever. So now Armor is happily scanning every device in my network to tell me the answer I already know: The devices are not vulnerable to any known exploits. And there is no apparent way to turn off the Armor service. I expect after the trial ends that I will get an endless stream of spam from them begging me to pay for the overpriced and unnecessary subscription. I love the Obri hardware. I do not love the Orbi app or Netgear's hard sell of subscription services I know I do not need or want.","Freezes half the time. Says not connected to the network. Drops/clears speed test/Armor result history. Constantly forces ads at you to sell you their services. Drains the battery even when not open. Now with the newest update, it lists every MAC address that's ever connected to your network with no way if filtering to only view active devices. WebUI shows router firmware updates available but app says everything is up to date. I can with confidence say I'll never buy Netgear products again.","Installation was horrible. App froze several times, I waited, it failed repeatedly. Restarting left me guessing what to do. still don't see options to set IP ranges and other tailored setup things. no way to skip the armor 30 day demo. I work in IT and have been doing this stuff for 30 years, I don't know how people who don't have that experience get this stuff setup.","Not a substitute for the web browser interface. Very few available settings can actually be modified with this app, and worst of all the security settings are locked behind a subscription paywall. Either they're behind the paywall or the app actually has no security settings and they simply link to the panhandling $$ ask. Installing this app has led me to regret ever purchasing an orbi mesh router."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.dragonflow.android.orbi","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dragonflow.android.orbi&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Wondr Note - Pretty notes, lists, countdown & more","description":"Wondr Note is a creative & unique take on notes & lists.

It's cuter and a lot more functional, and you can add tags to keep up with everything, kind of like hashtags. You can add pictures, agendas, lists, and even keep track of finances, as well as a lot of customization features at your disposal. I had it crash on me but support was responsive, however I recommend to people to back up often just in case it crashes. The customer service is awesome, and I will recommend this app to my folks!","I honestly don't usually write reviews but the latest update was so good that I have to sing it's praises. The slicker UI makes navigating the app, which already was good, a breeze. The new agenda features which let me plan ahead, as well as the UI making it a pleasure to use, has made me switch to using this as my main ToDo list. Fantastic! I applaud the team behind such a wonderful app. Keep up the good work!","Really cute note taking app! It's a little confusing at first but well made. It would be nice to have a feature to toggle dark mode/light mode from within the app though. Also, maybe an easier way to delete notes from the main screen! Keep up the good work!","It's still a new app, so features are limited, but I really like it! The functionality it does have works well and I really appreciate the visual customization. Can't wait to see what else the devs have in store for this gem!","Wish I didn't pay for premium. The widgets don't work,I can open the app and make agendas but I can't put it on my homescreen because the widget doesn't work for me. Smh, it's too bad because it's cute af and I would love to be able to use it."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.q61.note","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.q61.note&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Word Office - Docx, Excel, Slide, Office Document","description":"Word Office - Docx, Excel, Slide, PDF Edit & View has the ability to convert files .docx to pdf reader.

","comments":["The app was great on Android until the last month with the new updates. 1. It takes 2 minutes for the app to open. 2. It crashes and sometimes doesn't save my note. 3. My note when I lightly swipe my screen. 4. When I open a note, it opens in view only mode and doesn't allow me to edit. I have to close and re-open and refresh a few times to use it. I have had to use another app so I can quickly jot down notes. Considering using Onenote if this issue isn't fixed. At least it saves my work.","I've been using this app for the last 8 years and it has been amazing, but the last updates have made the app completely unusable. There is simply no way to launch the app as it crashes before opening... This is part of the reasons I have not purchased the Pro version yet... There's always issues either with the widgets or the app. There is no support, and now, no app either. Please fix this ASAP or like many, I'll be forced to use a different app or even the default apps of the phone.","Great app, I use it a lot in conjunction with my rocketbook. Just wish it had more widgets like a calendar, todo list, sticky note, alerts, etc that correlated with their in app stuff... it really helps to remember things to have up front reminders in my face all the time on my phone and computer. I'm very forgetful. My desk is covered in sticky notes lol","Seems that data integrity was quite low on their list of priorities for the new version. Also requires a full time internet connection if you want to view even your offline notes. Offline doesn't seem to mean what it used to. No good for fieldwork with unconnected tablet. Need to use some other note app and then copy notes to Evernote once an internet connection is available.","Horrible just horrible. 10-year subscriber. What have you done to this app. If you try to save something to Evernote using Android share mode it automatically assigns a tag from some previous note and you can't get rid of it unless you save it and then reopen it and then delete that tag. Multi-step process. Come on man. Pathetic. In edit. You still can't add a tag if you try to save a note. Have to save the note reopen it, clear tags then add a tag.

I pay a monthly subscription fee for all features of Xodo and I use it every day. So I wasn't very happy that Xodo required complete access to my device's file system as well as cloud services without any guardrails. However, they recently updated to give users the ability to choose which files to allow Xodo to access. Love it! Thanks for being a responsive company and dev team!","I've been using this app for months now, and it functions well, no bugs or whatever that interrupts you from what you are doing in the app. One of the best things about this is that, it doesn't have any ads nor have any distractions. And the worse thing about this app is that the \"Reading Mode\" feature doesn't seem to be pleasing for reading because the letters are not arrange perfectly... Please fix it :))","This is a great free pdf viewer. Every feature works nearly flawlessly, if a little slow every now and again. My biggest complaint, and what kept me from giving a 5 star review, is that in order to get the Pro version, you have to pay a subscription. A one time fee would be plenty understandable, but unless you are providing new content regularly, a subscription for a mostly static app, in terms of features and content, is just ridiculous and insulting. These companies need to get it together.","Pages turn black all of a sudden. I have to exit the app and again open it in order to fix this and also when I add pages they randomly add on a different page rather than the selected page. When I try to zoom in on something important again the entire page becomes black. I get frustrated by this all the time. Please fix this.","New update which makes the draw function unuseable kills the app. You write one letter and it highlights the letter to change it's size.

Each new version includes bug fixes and stability improvements to deliver you the best Dashlane experience. We’ll also update you regularly about new feature releases and improvements.","comments":["The UI is the most significant USP of Dashlane, no other password manager offers an experience as smooth as Dashlane. VPN, dark web monitoring, etc are some cool nifty features but the service still has room for improvement. Most importantly - let the users manually enter the security key instead of using the QR code scanner when enabling 2FA for a website/app (like Instagram or Snapchat) through the in-built Dashlane authenticator.","A lot of useful options but the most important one does not work the way it supposed to. Despite the fact I set Dashlane as a main autofill service, it works only occasionally. The thing that buggers me the most is the fact that the app ignores websites on which I'm trying to sign up. I was so impressed by the price and the possibilities that I bought the family subscription blindfold but I'm about to ditch the idea because, for example, Gboard autofill JUST WORKS. Disappointed.","I have tried various password managers till date like lastpass,1password,passwarden and many more but the features dashlane offers as per the price are phenomenal...ya but the experience on windows 10 app was not quite good....which needs to be improved... rather gr8 for chrome extension and Android...1password beats dashlane in user experience but is quite much more expensive as compared ....in addition the free version of dashlane is pretty much usable as compared to other competitors...","Easier to use than most password managers. Great on a PC but it stumbles with a cellphone. Also, dropping the desktop app in favour of a browser app has meant loss of info and the notes have not been carried over. The older version was a 5 star app but they had to go and \"fix\" it! 🤦‍♂️","Easy to use and good features. Overall my favourite password manager.

Starting with entering your password, it doesn't ask you to confirm it and covers what you entered, so if you've miss typed something, you'll never know it. When doing a reset using 'forgot password', the first email never came to reset it. Fortunately, the second one did, but that still didn't matter because the app would not take the reset password. Nor does the app allow you to use your finger print to log in. This was one of the shortest lived apps on my android phone.","Not bad, but please show card numbers, not just QR codes. I need to be able to see the number of my identity card. Also, if I enter barcode manually, I want to see a barcode, not QR code. And app should ask me about card number when I add a new card.","Used to work ok. Just came back from a grossery store being unable to use my offline cards which are essensially just screenshots of barcodes because \"the service is unavailable\". Don't tell me there needs to be a service and an internet connection to show a simple image I could take with my camera. I absolutely believed 'offline' mode is actually offline. Very disappointed. I cannot longer trust this since I have no idea if it will fail the next time I check out.","I really love this app! That is why it makes me sad that I can't give it five stars ✨ It's really great because you can carry your reward cards 💳 stored in your phone so you don't have to carry around the additional card holder. The only problem is that sometimes it doesn't want to load. Then you end up either holding up the line or telling them nevermind because you can't access the cards you want. Love that I can even take a picture of the cards if I want. Has saved me a few times in a pinch!","I get locked out every night. The short cut goes from my home screen and when I try to log in it says my email address is wrong. However when I change my pass word I do get an email with a link to change it but after In putting the new one. It states again wrong email or password. Even when the fields are blank.

LOUD and obnoxious ads that intentionally hide the mute button so you have to frantically look for it while your phone is blasting game sounds. Basically have to avoid the free version in an office, library, around sleeping kids, seminars, you name it. By far the most jarring ad scheme I've ran into.

Very very usefull to useing our local languages. But i've questions you know play store offers latest app for user. that ridmik keyboard version 2021 is not bad but i remember ridmik keyboard older version future systems and emojis etc were the best future ever from every kinds of user experience. really it is the best app for every android user. Thanks","It's a great app. I would say one of the best keyboards for Bangali typing. Have been using this app for many years. But still I'm rating 4 as this keyboard is unable to suggest the right words depending on my typing history and all, which G-board does finely. It's not capable to guess the next word and suggest, no matter if I write the same sentence a million times. Technically, the word suggestion option is not beneficial but for the spelling correction. Upgrade it, if possible.","Developer brothers, please update it regularly. This is my favorite keyboard. In last 2/3 months, I have found it problematic whenever I try to type anything with ে, ো, ি, ু and attached alphabet. It becomes মৃতয়ু when I wanted to type মৃত্যু। I have to type it again to make it correct as it doesn't work in the first phase. Same thing happens when I type \"ভাই\", it became \" ভআই\"....I don't know why! And spelling like this, everything got glitched. Please take immediate actions.","I am using this app from many years in my & family's all android devices. There were no problem. But in this (Redmi 9 Power) device the keyboard layout has some key's label are white color like Capitalize, 123, emoji, coma, period & bacspace. I checked all settings and uninstall the apps with restart the device. Same result. Are you listening me?","A great app. But if it would contain Arabic also, it could have been more useful for people. Because, We have to keep more one keyboard for Arabic beside this app. This app can a great package with Bengali, English & Arabic for Bangladeshi people."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"ridmik.keyboard","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ridmik.keyboard&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"PDF Converter - Image to PDF, JPG to PDF Editor","description":"Free PDF Converter: Image to PDF Converter.

An update: the feature which allows you to block area codes does not work. I've tried un installing and reinstalling but still doesn't work. I've looked over other call-blocking apps and they seem no better. This one's free with NO ads. I'll stick with it and its imperfections.","No ads from what I've seen and used and this app is legit it truly tells the phone number and the identification of the person or who ever is on the other end of the phone call. It also lists the call duration along with giving you options on how to respond to phone call. So to me this app \"Call Detector\" has been really useful & super helpful I'm so glad I came across this application. Thank you!","The only plus is that it shows what city the call is from but barely from WHO. Has never blocked a call yet! No way to include detail on scam/nuisance calls so how on earth can this app work to eliminate the garbage overall? I see that the last update was 12/19? Database needed to determine whether missed call falls into a blocking category or to indicate such call is coming in. Deleting this memory eater. TRASH! \"Should I Answer\" is a much better app.","Does a pretty goid job ... doesn't catch everything. But it's a big help. The identification window goes away pretty quickly and I have to later look at the list on the app. So, I may have let some calls go unanswered until I have a chance to check. I am still learning how to work with it and form a safe contact list.","Call detector is a must-have a must-needed app takes all the worries out of unnecessary unwanted calls the classifies them and then give you a little notice telling you block or not block I don't know where I would be without it but I would probably be going crazy and pulling my hair out thank you call detector great job"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.privacystar.android.tracfone","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.privacystar.android.tracfone&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"WinZip – Zip UnZip Tool","description":"Get the world’s #1 zip file opener on Android!

Absolutely appalling app with no way to contact anyone to try and get it fixed. Changed to adobe scan and no problems at all.","One of the few apps that scan on the go! Had a lot of trouble with those that need pictures taken cos of a bug, but this app makes scanning seamless and fast. I love how shadows eg of my phone are immediately removed too, unlike some of the other apps where the shadow stays. Worth the price imo.","This app is outstanding. It's a mobile office. I confidently engage in all document activity when it occurs.","I love this app and the yearly subscription is totally worth it. I have a critique: you should be able to share/email multiple files at once, that would greatly improve my productivity with this app! Love the app thanks for making it."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.glority.everlens","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.glority.everlens&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Status Download for WhatsApp - Video Status Saver","description":"Want to download your favorite videos from WhatsApp status?

You won't qualify for all surveys, and the zap store hasn't worked for me every time i use it so the safe bet is just using surveys. Transfers to £18 if you're in the uk though :)","By far the worse app ever. Gets stuck for days and you can't do anything. Don't think you will receive a response from the developers because I have sent numerous emails with no response. You won't be able to collect 7 cent check ins will give you one or two then say oops. The surveys are not under 5 minutes. I did one and it took 28 minutes. That was the last survey I took. It gave me 3 cents. It says they are under 1 minute for 10 cents on my screen and that is what I got.","the app isn't that bad whenever it starts glitching out I just uninstall and reinstall and it starts working again I've made enough money to cash out at least twice and I'm almost to a third time but I have had to deal with the uninstalling and reinstalling because the app does get stuck and you don't get credit for getting zapped or your daily check in and that kind of sex especially if you're doing a few days in a row like 150...","HORRIBLE. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. I liked it at first. Then I got up to a little over $12 and it's basically frozen. I still get notifications but when I click on them it takes me to the main screen and I can't click anything. Can't claim daily rewards. Can't claim location rewards. Nothing. You cannot cash out until $20. So all of my time and effort has been for nothing. I think the app is rigged to do this based on other reviews I've read. You all should be ashamed for lying to people.","I guess it eventually pays you out but it took me over a year of daily check ins to reach the minimum cash out balance. when I first downloaded the app it was $20 minimum but like 10cents away from the goal the app updated and changed to $25 minimum. but I now have reached that and I'm waiting for the payment to deposit in my account any day now"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.zap.surveys","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zap.surveys&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Planning Center Services","description":"You must already have an account with Planning Center to use this app. To sign up for an account subscription, have your organization's administrator go to https://planningcenter.com\r\n\r\n===== Planning Center Services: ======\r\n\r\nPlanning Center Services is an online scheduling and worship planning application to keep your staff and volunteers connected.\r\n\r\nWith our native Android app, you get an optimized Planning Center Services experience wherever you are!

I frequently use it for my weekly shopping, but also for deciding what movies to watch with the kids, and tasks/chores needed in the house. Sharing the list makes it easy to manage shopping (or chores) across multiple people. Highly recommended. The one con is the premium version is only offered as a subscription. I would be far more comfortable simply buying a lifetime license.","I bought the premium version so that I could share the list with my whole family. The convenience of us all having the list & being able to add things & take things off when purchased is great. My only complaint is that even though I bought the premium version, I'm still the only person out of the 5 of us who can add pictures to go with items on the list. That's not time saving or convenient for me. I'm still having to flip back to a pic that one of my teens texted me & the list until I add it.","This app is brilliant, and my boyfriend and I are always trying to talk other couples or roommates into getting it. It's easy to use, it's fun to add things while someone else is shopping because you can see by what items are crossed off, what sections of the store they haven't been to yet. We have premium and enjoy the recipe importation, even though it's slightly finnicky. Being able to put a photo of the item on the list is a bonus, too!","This app has really helped my menu planning and grocery shopping become a fun factor in my day. What makes it really fun is sharing with my sister-in-law (we both subscribe) and reading her comments on recipes and seeing what is on her grocery list and other shard lists. This app has a lot of great features the best of which is being able to filter grocery lists in multiple stores and categorizing and arranging them by location to each store. And much more.","I installed this app and paid for the family premium after seeing that when I add grocery items, it automatically categories and categories, when I tried to create a different list, that didn't happen. I think they do it simply to trick us to upgrade but after you've upgraded then you realize there's nothing more explore.

My opinion remains - the UX is unfriendly and unintuitive. I'm sure this makes sense to a programmer but not a user. Also, I want the ability to generate a password BEFORE I commit to creating a login. Norton has this. The method you propose assumes I am creating a login in the app, but this is not how people create logins. For $70 per year, this needs a significant overhaul. At this point, I'm seeking a refund. I thought I could put up with the issues, but it's too much.","Not sure what happened here but .... It is not the same and this is before the new versions being released. Things like stating they have Linux client when it's not really a full client, just a snap or maybe python coded program to present their web vault like a client. Then other areas where instructions were literally copy and paste credentials .... Isn't that part of the reason for a. Password Manager? Sometimes is one thing but as a necessity in some scenarios? Use BitWarden, 1Pass done","I love this app. The Family Plan and sharing vaults has been instrumental in getting my elderly parents to FINALLY get a password manager. My only feedback is that the built-in browser is very unhelpful and often has trouble rendering important websites. I wish I could configure this app to open links in a browser app of my choice by tapping the url.","Have liked this app before... this version will not allow me to enable biometric unlock and keeps crashing before I can use it to fill in a username/password. Crashes over and over. Allows me to slide the button for bio unlock, but does not ask for a fingerprint confirmation and does not enable the feature. App is currently useless.","Love it BUT.... It doesnt work on my tablet in DEX mode Samsung S7+ 5g Ultra. Really silly, cos its the only way i use my tablet. I now need to open my phone find the password stored, then go back to tablet and enter it.... Which is really stupid when 1password sets a 20+ multi character password. please fix this"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.agilebits.onepassword","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agilebits.onepassword&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"iClean - Booster, Super Virus Cleaner, Master","description":"iClean is one of the most effective Super Junk Cleaner for Android phone and boost your devices for better performance.

Dropped it from 5 to 2 stars. Wallet has become ridiculously slow, even just to load balance. I use Ledger, after I use it I need to restore it on Yoroi everytime if I want to use it again. Keep getting error message. You started out great but went downhill quickly. I'm off to research better choices. Down to 1 star. Now wallet won't even sync. You guys just get worse daily.","Look into other alternatives, Yoroi, and Emurgo by extension, have awful server consistancy and customer support. My wallet won't sync to their networks and I haven't been able to access my ADA for a while now. No phone number to call for help, sent a few emails with no responses back, kinda getting ridiculous. The only reason I didn't freak out was because I checked Twitter and saw I wasn't the only one having problems, not that Yoroi is acknowledging any of them, just crickets on their end.","The wallet still won't let me use biometrics to sign on with my galaxy s10e , even though it promotes it as a feature, also the updating of funds is often slow or even the intrawallet withdrawal is often glitchy, works, but needs a lot of work","Can be slow at times.

Allows you to use any audio file as an alarm, but unlike most others, you can set the duration. You can have it repeat the alarm sound until you take the action to stop it or you can set an alarm duration for as short as one second. That means I can set a chime that only plays only once at a certain time every day that reminds me to do something instead of having to silence a repeating alarm sound. That feature alone is worth 5 stars!","Used to be a great app, but they keep adding these cutesy things, like a screan that tells me 'good night' that I have to close instead of just closing the app when I hit the 'Dismiss' button. At least give us a way to turn off these new things when you add them. Or better yet, let us turn them on if we want them. I've used this app for 6 or 7 years now, but I'm now thinking there has to be something better out there.","I've used this app for several years. I have anywhere from 5-12 alarms I use any given day. The most recent update is forcing the \"my dashboard\" to open after every dismissed alarm. I'm already clearing our ads. Now I have another wasted step to my day. I cannot get it to go away and have turned off all settings. I used to love this app but I'm about to switch to another.","I have been using this app for about 10 years now. Recent updates have been painful. I have been taking them into my stride. One of the major issues I have is this: I have 3 or 4 alarms set at the same time. When the alarm notification appears and when I dismiss the topmost alarm - I don't see the remaining alarm notifications..and that is dangerous! If this is not fixed soon, I will be looking for another alarm application.","This was my favorite. I have to wake up at 5am to take a pill but then sleep until I need to get up. The new day popup with a \"good morning \" message blocks the next alarm and I haven't dismissed it on a few occasions which has been terrible. A previous version had allowed me to turn this off but not now. What happened? This has happened to me multiple times. I have a Samsung S8+ and now upgraded to a Samsung S10+. The steps that I have observed on the S8+ (and caused me to be late to work a couple of times) are: 1. I create two alarm clock options: 5am and 6:30am 2. The 5am alarm clock goes off and I dismiss it 3. It displays the \"Good Morning\" message. 4a. If I don't dismiss the \"Good morning\" message closing with the tiny x on the popup after the advertisements are also closed, the 6:30 am alarm doesn't go off. 4b. If I dismiss the Good morning message from the 5am alarm, at 6:30 the second alarm will go off as anticipated. When I discovered this, I found that under Settings> My Day Dashboard, there was a way to turn off the feature entirely. Now that I upgraded to the S10+, the setting is gone. All I can configure is what shows up on the screen. I just tested this on the S10+ with two alarms one minute from each other leaving the Good morning message up, and the second alarm did go off, but I am nervous to depend on it because I have seen it fail. Thank you so much for taking the time to reply. I used to see the two options for \"Show after standard alarm\" and \"Show after quick alarm\" on a previous version on my Samsung S8+, but they are gone since this last update and I tried to run it on my Samsung S10+. When I went back to my S8+, it is now as with the S10+ too. I only have two entries \"My calendar events\" and \"Weather forecast\". I have version 7.0.1 70002976 and I am running on Android version 11.

Very convenient to organize baby files! Only missing feature: There is no confirmation that the file transfer completed successfully window only close upon completion (wished for large transfer as when I transfer all photos from my phone to the network).","The app works. I would normally buy the premium option except the prices are obnoxiously high. The app is that good to charge 50 bucks. Especially since most other apps with similar pricing are often abandoned by the developer because no one wants to pay for underwelming upgrade options for typically half the value of most phones after one year of use. Not something id consider investing in. Drop the full premium price to like 15 would sound more reasonable and drop the whole subscription idea","I tried this app for functionality because it was the closest to ES File Explorer since they took down the app. Tried it, became a paid subscriber in two days. Very convenient UI. I had an issue with file transfer to cloud but the developers corrected it quickly. I would highly recommend RS File : File Manager & Explorer to anyone looking for the convenience of a desktop folder manager.","UPDATE : i would have given it 5 stars but the issue gets more bitter when i wasn't able to login another google drive cloud it keeps saying 'auth failed' after given all 7 permissions to my account. please fix the issue. app is not stable, it always gets interrupted while transferring files from cloud to device in background, i've even turned off battery optimisation for this app but that didn't helped at all, this stability issue should be fixed, please fix this on the next update, regards.","I give 4 stars because it can not connect to yandex . I have tried tons of file manager only two filemanager can connect to yandex easily. The most problem of why they can not connected because when I choose yandex, and they provide only simple interface such as alias, uname and password to fill in, no directly to yandex service.

Allow me to elaborate, been using it for two years now so it's not a bad app, but it doesn't work super well. Manually enter your tracking or scan it, that works well. The only real issue is the fact that it doesn't routinely reach out and pull updates from carriers. Routinely I will have 3 packages out for delivery per the carrier, and the app says is still in X location. Pull down to refresh and it won't truly update the status.","It's a tracking app alright! It tracks what you're buying and sent to your house so it can sell your data to advertising companies. What better way to advertise to you by tracking what you're buying on Amazon, eBay, AliExpress, Banggood. That's why it asks you what platform you bought your item from and what category it belongs in. You're handing over your data on a silver platter.","Seems to be the only app with always accurate information. Info on orders from AliExpress can be confusing because every app has different tracking info. I always use 17 track to know what is really going on... also automatically adds a tracking number copied in memory, very convenient.","Awesome app, for some reason amazon employees placed every single item i ordered in their own parcels so i had 11 tracking numbers. If its just one its fine to check through amazon to see were its at but 11 a bit annoying. Just open one app to see were all my parcels are Thanks for the app!","I like the app, pretty easy and fast to use.

Must click okay, but the ok button is not able to be clicked. Would be nice if the developers would at least acknowledge this issue and fix it. Looks like this has been on-going for at least a week...I'd really like to use my printer app as it is vital for what I do.","Annoying window pops up without ability to hit Ok. No matter if I select the checkbox or not. Uninstalled, reinstalled, same result, box does not go away. Samsung Note 9. Update: After looking at another phone I attempted same install. A smaller font size exposed 2 checkboxes. After I reduced my font size, i could see the 2 checkboxes. The application was not designed to account for a larger font size. The print service plugin now works as normal.","No issues until today. Now when I try to print, it won't let you proceed until you click \"ok\" on a terms/conditions pop up and the \"ok\" button is grayed out. I need to print docs for a customer who insists on ink signing vs esigning, and now I'm going to have to go to FedEx to print. Unacceptable!","No problems until today. I go to print and cannot connect to any printer until I review the terms and conditions. When the box pops up, I click the checkbox to share info, and the \"OK\" button at the bottom corner does not work, no matter what I do. Uninstalled for now so that I could use one that will work.","Loved this app for years, now with most recent update I cannot get beyond the question if I want to share data to improve app! It doesn't matter if I click the box or not, hitting the ok does nothing and it won't let me print until I got ok to clear it from screen.

But I got sick of the popup, which happened EVERYTIME I wanted to use the app, so I downloaded the update. Big mistake. I am not impressed with the new interface. As others have said, it takes much longer to connect, messages are slow to load, if they even do. I'm constantly having to close and reconnect and even then, it isn't working. I don't like the dashboard, which is messy. When it works, it's fine, but not ideal. When it doesn't, which is most of the time, it's frustrating and a time waster.","I really like the new features and layout. However, when I choose to uncheck \"Send anonymous statistics from my phone\" it will. Everytime the app is closed or is restarted, it's checked again. Same thing is happening with the desktop app. I don't want to send any data. Hope this is just a bug that can be resolved. I til then, I'll leave it at 3 stars and probably won't use the app often.","EXCELLENT!!!!!! I can select many photos or videos at once to load onto my PC. Notifications are going through just fine, calls too. If you follow directions and scan code it works perfectly and instantly! MAKE SURE TO ALLOW ACCESS!! I see lots complaints but everything works great for me! Better than last version and I absolutely loved that one too!!","The new Dell Mobile Connect would not stay connected, Every time i went to use the app, I had to wait for the connection. I had Dell technicians try to troubleshoot, but the connectivity problem continued to exist. I uninstalled the new Dell Mobile Connect and reinstalled the Dell Mobile Connect 3.3 and it is working just fine.","This update contains more organization in terms of laying out widgets (features like messages and contacts) that can be used simultaneously unlike version 3.3. It was a few days after that I am getting problems accessing my phone messages on my computer. I tried disconnecting and reconnecting, but nothing. The rest still works well."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.screenovate.dell.mobileconnectng","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.screenovate.dell.mobileconnectng&hl=en&gl=us"}]
