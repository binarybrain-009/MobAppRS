They are really always in the background. Talking with them is a breath of fresh air. No condemnation.just quiet checking through the problem. Sometimes you don't know they are evolved. Until later when everything is fixed . I haven't used the storage yet. But I'm getting ready for a big transfer with it. Trust is the word I'd use to for an overall principle. Hats off to the team which makes Google human.💃⚘🌴-Kathryn Lynn Florida","I was finally able to upgrade. I had to request a phone call and Marcus in your support team was amazing. Please work on your chat support, they can't just be transferring you all over and having to repeat your story all over again. It is not the first time it happens with the chat support and i want people downloading this app to be aware of it.","Received 1 yr free with chromebook and paid for a year, the subscription got cancelled after a year and subscription terminated, now there is no convienient way to reach support to resolve issue as the support gets terminated as well as the extra storage. I sure hope my data/backups have not permenently disappeared with that storage because it would damage the trust given to google to hold my data in the cloud.","I wish Google would hire less marketing idiots to run things - this is a good example of implementation gone wrong . The alleged larger storage plan - has the fine line of being shared amongst all the family members. The so-called up to 40% discount on hotels - I have never gotten that. 2 out 3 times the so-called \"Great Deal\" price is gone or never existed in the first place and don't even try to book some place that is popular, or on the weekends. You are going to get better rates direct from the hotel. So what are we paying for? You tell me. CrApple has their lemmings who lap-up every stool sample they sell - to beat them you should invest in better products - not more marketing.","When I get my phone I had difficulties getting some of the apps even though I had time on my phone. Also getting connected to the network so you could actually look things up. I lost a lot of my photos if you don't know exactly if they went in albums or not.

If this has nothing to do with this app well that's just too damn bad because I am unable to figure out how to review the Google drive on the computer.

It's always take long time on my phone to open the file even if my connection is good. After takes time, sometimes it's failed. Please fix this issue. I have been using for few months still get same issue. Sometimes if I need urgent file to open, I need to turn on my computer to get faster.","Works great. Would love to have face catagorization and better search results though. I don't like that the search bar does not show albums in the results. It should show albums first if you are searching in the pictures section of the app. Aside from that so far so good. I got 1 year of 365 for 60% off by being a game pass subscriber so I'm giving the service a shot. It's good, but can be better. It's third with Amazon photos, and google photos besting it. Good work though guys. Keep it up! :)","Personally, I would say this app is the one app I use almost every day. It's great for storing everything & once you have it setup, it can in the background keep everything up to date. It isn't hard to install, setup & use. Give it a try !!","As with any Microsoft app, all things good aside from a tad of nagging issues that clearly had no thorough thinking when implemented. PROs are simpleness, efficiency, functionality and very fast operation. CONs one of the biggest issue is that sharing files lacks manageability, signalling and transparency. You should be able to better track, start, stop, analyze what you shared and who accessed/modified shared stuff. All in all one of the best i used for cloud storage though. GG","Thanks so much Samsung, thank you for putting my phone in safe mode and making it IMPOSSIBLE for me to transfer my data before I factory reset.. like there's nothing I can do to fix this, I am stuck and will probably end up losing all my valuable pictures and videos.

However, this is an incredible app for scanning and sharing without having access to a conventional scanner. Simply amazing!!!","Used to be a great app. Now it is just full of ads. Can't use it at work anymore because so much time is lost viewing these ads as they take over my work phone. One time I tried to view an ad intentionally so they could remove the watermark from an important work document. I did it, let it lock my screen for 45 seconds with an ad, and then the send failed so I retried and sure as can be the watermark was still there on the doc. Gonna buy one of those compact blade scanners. Better image imo.","Enjoyed the features and found the app very useful. However, lately the app always crashes whenever I type the name of a document in the search box after which everything freezes and I have to close the app. I tried restarting my phone but I'm encountering the same problem.

I would not recommend using this to make a new document for what ever that may be from start to finish. It doesn't have ALL the features or tools that you'd normally see on an actual computer. However, I think it is possible for them to incorporate more tools than it has now or at least close to it!","Not bad at all, but still stuck in 'paper world' from the previous century. Everything is pages and margins for docs that may never be printed. This app really needs a continues page option. Something similar to the 'Web Layout' you have in the desktop app. The mobile view does not support drawing. Aside from that, it is really a good app.","Nice App. But after the update in July, the available font options reduced. One can no longer select the type of font options to use. It had all the fonts available for selection, but after thr update, we have about only 10 fonts for usage. This is supposee to be an alternative to the PC version, making us able to do all we can do with our phone version too. Please kindly look into this issue. Thanks","Honestly, this app is everything I could have ever wanted. It allows me to work on the docs I created on my laptop on my phone.

My note when I lightly swipe my screen. 4. When I open a note, it opens in view only mode and doesn't allow me to edit. I have to close and re-open and refresh a few times to use it. I have had to use another app so I can quickly jot down notes. Considering using Onenote if this issue isn't fixed. At least it saves my work.","I've been using this app for the last 8 years and it has been amazing, but the last updates have made the app completely unusable. There is simply no way to launch the app as it crashes before opening... This is part of the reasons I have not purchased the Pro version yet... There's always issues either with the widgets or the app. There is no support, and now, no app either. Please fix this ASAP or like many, I'll be forced to use a different app or even the default apps of the phone.","Great app, I use it a lot in conjunction with my rocketbook. Just wish it had more widgets like a calendar, todo list, sticky note, alerts, etc that correlated with their in app stuff... it really helps to remember things to have up front reminders in my face all the time on my phone and computer. I'm very forgetful. My desk is covered in sticky notes lol","Seems that data integrity was quite low on their list of priorities for the new version. Also requires a full time internet connection if you want to view even your offline notes. Offline doesn't seem to mean what it used to. No good for fieldwork with unconnected tablet. Need to use some other note app and then copy notes to Evernote once an internet connection is available.","Horrible just horrible. 10-year subscriber. What have you done to this app. If you try to save something to Evernote using Android share mode it automatically assigns a tag from some previous note and you can't get rid of it unless you save it and then reopen it and then delete that tag. Multi-step process. Come on man. Pathetic. In edit. You still can't add a tag if you try to save a note. Have to save the note reopen it, clear tags then add a tag.

I have to hit two buttons every time I log in, but it does just what I asked it to. Four stars until today. Today none of my folders open. So now five years of passwords I can't access. Guess what the solution is? The paid version. They gave me 20% off to get my data, which is like an old fashioned robbery where they didn't take all my money and I should be grateful. I am not. Back to pen and paper I go. Probably the safest option these days.","Recent issue accessing via Folders is known issue (hopefully being fixed). Workaround is go to LIST view!! Stop giving bad reviews when app has worked flawlessly for you, for many, many years and for free. All apps have bugs, so give them a chance to fix before putting a bad review. Keeper - help yourself by proactively alerting users to this issue and avoid the bad press!!!!","The new update won't let you look through your folders, to access your passwords you have to go through lists, which is ridiculous if you have as many accounts as I do. Been using Keeper for years, it was bad enough that you can't simply delete accounts you no longer use, but this put this over the top. I won't be renewing my account. They don't care either, we haven't been able to delete things for years, they just tell you to email them and all they give you is solutions that don't work.","Latest upgrade now reveals your user login name under the record name in the files list. Not good. I show people Keeper all the time to entice them to try it and don't want prying eyes seeing my login name. Why did you think this is useful? Build a setting to turn this off! Was 5 stars, now 4 stars. Already working with Rhea in Keeper Customer Service.","Edit: After losing access to my passwords, support helped me getting access back.

There was an update that had key menu options like renaming a document without tapping the \"edit\" button, then the next update its back to the original. The update before last allowed the app to show in dark mode, and the most recent update reverted.

I saw some users complaining about app freezing and all but it never happened to me and I'm glad. The only problem I am having is that it won't suggest words from my personal dictionary. It consumes a lot of time when I have to type a whole word repeatedly. It would be better if it adds the words in personal dictionary to suggestions more often. Other than this, I love this app.💜","I really like this app its help me to improve my writing skills everytime l write my story books. but the reason why I give it 3 stars because there are some issues 1. the keyboard will freeze for a second and not allow me to write anything 2.when l finished writing my notes or other stuff, the keyboard will also freeze on my screen even if I move to other app. It really bothered me to a lot, so please fix it! 🙂💙","I enjoyed it at first, then I started noticing it laggs after using it for an extensive period of time until I force stop it and run the app again, to make matters worse, it duplicates words when I try to delete, and, and if you're not careful the cursor moves back to your last text, making you delete what you've already typed. Fix this bug please, it's frustrating.","This is the best grammar and word correction app in the world! The only problem is the lack of a delete button. I can fix it ignore. My cursor will be at the right place until my keyboard pops up, then my cursor returns to the last place I typed instead. When I've written a lot, it's hard to find the word I need to delete. Please create simple delete button. I'll totally pay for it. Thanks guys, you're all awesome.","I thought it was a pretty good app at first. It really helped me add commas in the right places and with grammar. However it suggests wrong words that would make the sentence not evening make sence anymore. It also deletes words and adds letters to words making them not even words anymore. I'm uninstalling cause that is just annoying me now."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.grammarly.android.keyboard","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grammarly.android.keyboard&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Microsoft Excel: View, Edit, & Create Spreadsheets","description":"The Excel spreadsheet app lets you create, view, edit, and share your files with others quickly and easily.

This release includes: improved reliability and minor bug fixes.","comments":["Absolutely HORRIBLE! When it was a free app it worked great on all my devices, so when they decided to take that away I moved to a paid premium program and now this thing either gives me no result, for items in my account, or it gives me wrong logins and wrong passwords. Totally unreliable, do not use this app if you are truly relying on it to get into your accounts as you will spend more time trying to get the correct information, then on your site and that's only if you don't get locked out.","Free with limitations, why have to choose between Desktop and Mobile? I've used lastpass before this, its now a pain to use across devices. Lastpass is a hit and miss experience , the pop up box only appears 50% of the time, and not always the correct suggestions, I frequently have to copy and paste the details, leaving a password trail. Great database for storing passwords, card details, documents etc, cost of the premium is acceptable but it needs to work more than 50% for me to commit.","I've been using LastPass premium user for years now but my Andriod experience has been worse and worse and is just becomming intolerably frustrating. Just doesn't work half the time so I'm often struggling to log in. I don't mind paying but the Android app needs some serious work, it needs to be functional. Just terrible right now. Apple version works much, much better.","Still love it...This app has got to be the most useful app I've ever used. I only have to remember one password. LastPass does the rest. It's as secure as you could ever hope to find. it can be set to auto-fill your username and p/w for websites and apps, as well as save secure notes, credit card profiles, software licenses and any other information you want to keep private. I've been using LastPass for 6-7yrs now, and I'll still be using it for another 6-7yrs. Try it. You'll like it.","Zero stars. Unusable garbage on Android. It keeps getting worse and worse. The LastPass service is excellent and works great on Windows and iOS but is utterly worthless on Android. If you actually figure out how to get the persistent notification, it will ask for your fingerprint then show the autofill but hides it before you can use it."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.lastpass.lpandroid","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lastpass.lpandroid&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"DocuSign - Upload & Sign Docs","description":"DocuSign eSignature is the world’s #1 way to send and sign agreements from practically anywhere, at any time.

The improvements that I would like to see are 1) Being able to make folders so I can easily find recipes for Holidays, soups, vegetarian dishes, etc. 2) Be able to delete an individual item from the calendar, instead of all or nothing. 3) Be able to add recipes to a calendar where you can see what else is on there for the day.","App is not connecting on my computer, says its not connecting because of internet issues. So I uninstalled it and now it is gone. I need this, I depend on this calendar. In the 3 years I have had it. I NEVER had any issues. I don't want to log into it every time I go to the browser. I need the app PLEASE.","Currently not connecting to the internet on my computer. All other apps that need the internet are not having a problem connecting.

Hehe. Unlike other apps, this will allow all these features without the premium subscription. However there will be additional features in premium. But the ones that are free are more than enough for a better life, and morning routine. Good luck on your new routine. 🖤","One of the most reliable alarms I've used. And loud... Loud is very important for me since I'm an extremely deep sleeper with my narcolepsy. The loud ringtones, & the Random option, are great. Very rarely an alarm won't show up in my notification bar & won't go off. I'm not sure why but it does not happen very often. Although I do not like the newer message screen after you shut off an alarm. Sometimes if I'm in a hurry it's just an unnecessary extra step I have to wait on & deal with.","Most the time this is just a perfect app but i don't know exactly why but sometimes the alarm goes of for only a split second and then is off Edit: the update removed the cool graph feature to look when you have woken up and how it changed over time, i REALLY want it back, else i need to find a way to extract the dates into my own graph...","Love it! This alarm allows me to wake up to my favorite song through my Bluetooth earbuds. Exactly what I was looking for! The only thing I hate is the monthly subscription. The app should allow playing an entire Playlist or connection to a streaming music service with any monthly charges. The free version has ads and a one song alarm which suffices.","I've used this app for years now on multiple devices. I love all of the new ways they've added to help you wake up. It really does work.

I would recommend anyone to try it, as it works well, has kept my phones free from harmful issues cleaning up cache, freeing up space and the notifications let you know that it's got you covered or what issues are to be looked at. It is ever so easy to use. From my point of view it does what it says on the tin so to speak, but each to there own personal experiences and opinions, I'm happy to give it 5⭐s and a👍s up","I hate to say iy. This was the last chance for this cleaner. I no longer recommend getting this cleaner. It works to the point of placing ads on your phone that you can not clear unless you turn off your phone and restart the phone.. I was using the free app but with this problem. I do not recommend paying for it eather. I am removing this app for good.","My experience both today and a good 95% of the previous times and indeed still now in the present, this very enjoyable app has & given me & I'm very sure it will continue to give me the same level of enjoyment for the foreseeable future, natureably I recommend this excellent security app to everyone if it is indeed the best security you are looking for ok. Do your best & prove me WRONG!!. This app deserves 10 gold stars.","great app that works to help keep your device clean and running smoothly.I have this app on all my devices n it is free and there are very little ads to deal with. would recommend anyone else download as well n use regularly. Update: I have recently bought the yearly subscription for the premium cleaning app and will be informing you of any and all concerns, problems, or good things about the app once I try it out. It was only $11.99 per year n that's for the cleaner app only. Pretty cheap!","Update: This app does NOT get five stars, because updating my apps via APK Pure prompts an obsolescence message. Every time I tap the button to delete \"obsolete\" APK, my apps get ruined! | AVG Cleaner got rid of junk files on my phone and freed up some space for me. Yet the app is missing one option that would make it complete: the ability to skip stopping background processes. If I don't want to stop background apps/processes, then I should be able to deselect those items and press \"skip.\" |"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.avg.cleaner","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avg.cleaner&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Mobile Scanner - PDF Scanner App, Scan to PDF","description":"Mobile Scanner app is a Free, Fast Scanner for Android.

As in good integration with other apps and intuitive. But, the deal breaker for me as mentioned by others was the nagging to get you to upgrade to premium subscription. Yaaa, No! Uninstalled.

Worst of all is the popup window structure for opening projects in the web interface. There is NO AUTO SAVE! If you click off the project or task popup you lose everything you've entered. Saving is a bear. Sometimes it is an arrow. Sometimes it's a save button. Entering an alarm is an absurdly elaborate process. Ordering tasks is possible in the app; it's not possible in the web interface. The app has been out for years. I am shocked these issues have not been addressed.","Widget options are very minimal. Doesn't allow pulling in calendar events, so you'll still need to manage those obligations in another app. Subtasks on recurring tasks behave in a disconnected way in that you have to set up their recurrence separately and it can easily get out of sync. Date/recurrence input is unintuitive.","You have started making it worse. You killed the fun and satisfaction of swiping and checking off the task completely out of the screen by boomeranging it back while swiping. Now you have killed the minimalist design by showing the date and 'Today' text for all the tasks. Come on, I know only Today's items will be shown in the Today page. You don't have to show it with every task. Looks like I have to develop a Minimalist To Do app on my own.","It's alright. The UI feels rather out of date. Moving from one view to another for example feels like a chore. This could be done better by swiping. Since reminders are a premium feature the free version of the app is kind of pointless. It also seems like there is no option for a free trial of the pro version. Paying for an app before I know if Its any good, feels very outdated. Some features are restrictive without reason. For example you cant sort tasks manually in the today view.","Was pleasantly surprised with nice UI and ability to add and organize tasks. Got everything moved over from G Tasks and set to use Todoist. That was until I was waiting for a reminder to notify me a task is due. A notification of a task due is an integral part of task management. Unfortunately you must purchase the premium version for this to work, which in my opinion makes this app completely unusable."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.todoist","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.todoist&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"iTranslate Translator & Dictionary","description":"iTranslate is the leading free translator / traductor and dictionary app. Easily translate text or start voice-to-voice conversations in over 100 languages.

My opinion remains - the UX is unfriendly and unintuitive. I'm sure this makes sense to a programmer but not a user. Also, I want the ability to generate a password BEFORE I commit to creating a login. Norton has this. The method you propose assumes I am creating a login in the app, but this is not how people create logins. For $70 per year, this needs a significant overhaul. At this point, I'm seeking a refund. I thought I could put up with the issues, but it's too much.","Not sure what happened here but .... It is not the same and this is before the new versions being released. Things like stating they have Linux client when it's not really a full client, just a snap or maybe python coded program to present their web vault like a client. Then other areas where instructions were literally copy and paste credentials .... Isn't that part of the reason for a. Password Manager? Sometimes is one thing but as a necessity in some scenarios? Use BitWarden, 1Pass done","I love this app. The Family Plan and sharing vaults has been instrumental in getting my elderly parents to FINALLY get a password manager. My only feedback is that the built-in browser is very unhelpful and often has trouble rendering important websites. I wish I could configure this app to open links in a browser app of my choice by tapping the url.","Have liked this app before... this version will not allow me to enable biometric unlock and keeps crashing before I can use it to fill in a username/password. Crashes over and over. Allows me to slide the button for bio unlock, but does not ask for a fingerprint confirmation and does not enable the feature. App is currently useless.","Love it BUT.... It doesnt work on my tablet in DEX mode Samsung S7+ 5g Ultra. Really silly, cos its the only way i use my tablet. I now need to open my phone find the password stored, then go back to tablet and enter it.... Which is really stupid when 1password sets a 20+ multi character password. please fix this"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.agilebits.onepassword","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agilebits.onepassword&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Ever Accountable - Rise Above Pornography","description":"Are you tired of feeling like you can't quit porn?\r\n\r\nWe have the solution: You choose to be accountable to someone. \r\nThe American Society of Training and Development (ATSD) found that by having a committed accountability partner, your chance of success increases by 95%.\r\n\r\nAnd, after surveying thousands of our customers, we found that 84-96% of pornography viewing is completely eliminated by using Ever Accountable.

Often slow and unresponsive, and the widget will freak out if I even look at it wrong. I'm sorry that your job is using this service","This app sucks. Constantly have to update it. It only works when it wants to. So the price you pay is not worth it. It should be a free app, when it screws up all the time.","Constant bugs for important things. E.g. the calendar is one day ahead all of a sudden and claims it's Friday (it's not, it's Thursday), so it says I'm scheduled for today (when I'm scheduled for Friday). It was on time all week until just today, and now it looks like I missed my shift. Luckily I worked it out with my manager, but this is unacceptable.

Buy Eufy floodlight camera instead as these app features work flawlessly. I know because I also have one.","After the last firmware update it take 15-20 minutes before I get a notification on my cell. Also it doesn't capture everyone on the camera. I use this for front door security, and it didn't capture me coming home with my wife. Absolutely useless as a security camera.","Why can't D-Link make a more user friendly app? Sure the cameras are ok but your app sucks. It seems like the more cameras I buy and put around my house the more difficult it is to set them all up and my newest addition isn't even showing up in the list of cameras that I have to schedule it. Please do not reply to this review, that takes precious time away from revamping and creating an awesome app.","I've had nothing but problems with both the app and the water sensors. The app only partially downloaded onto my iPad then I could neither complete the download nor restart it nor delete the partial download. I then downloaded the app onto an Android phone. When adding devices the app often \"spins\" forever and I need to restart the phone. This app is not ready for prime time.

I have to call to reset they password to login they are closed currently.

But the sound recognition seems to be utterly baffled by the background noise of the roads. I wish this app were better than it is.","Accurate. Two major issues. 1) The app stops listening after just 20 secs, making it difficult to use for anything besides consistent speech. This time limit is not adjustable. As a student hoping to use this for notes, this one flaw makes it almost useless. 2) Not integrated with any other app. Google Docs and Word have decent free transcription built in, why pay for the hassle of exporting docs in and out of a proprietary app? Something like Gboard with customizable listening time I'd pay for.","What a joke. \"Free\" app cannot do anything without a subscription. Nuance has always had a problem with overpriced software. They don't seem to realize that when people can't afford it they won't buy it and they're going to make less money. But they got those greedy eyes with the dollar signs, and corporate psychopathy.

I hardly ever have more than one timed event a day, if that, so that portion basically goes unused.","I like this calander app so far. Really like that it let's u add stickers &pick colors for whatever u write on a specific day. One thing I saw on another calander app that I wish this one did was, if I put someone's bday on a certain day then I could 'check it' as something that happens every year on that date &the app would fill the calander out for u, whatever you typed for that day for years and years or however long u keep the app. Hope that all made since. Cute app all together tho.","I was a paper planner person for years, this is the first digital planner that eve comes close, I love it.

I used IFTTT heavily previously and haven't been using it much in recent times. It used to be a very reliable tool. With the current paid version, it doesn't even run most of the times in spite of providing required permissions. For instance, I have an applet which reads notification and sends out a message. I have been testing it and the applet runs only when I manually hit the 'Check Now' button and never gets triggered automatically. For a tool with $6 a month charge, it a totally a let down performance. Looks like I might not go ahead with the subscription at this point .","It executes the commands whenever it wants . Unacceptable the fact that they even ask for a premium version when their free already suck . Hopefully the next update will fix this . Their WiZ command \"when I get home turn lights on\" doesn't turn the lights on even when I am 9n the same room . Absolutely ridiculous. My device is Xiaomi Redmi note 8 . Running WiZ app with google assistant , and IFFT. PLS FIX","Used to be great but after adding a paywall it's kinda dumb now (feedback has been submitted on Twitter but I doubt they'll do anything with it anyways). Also, you say it's optional to go pro but it's really not to people who had many custom applets already created, and are going to archive all but 3 in the near future.","Most of these criticisms apply to their website as well, so take that as you will. Charging people for functionality that other apps offer for free is stupid (Tasker anyone?). 99% of Twitter functionality doesn't work, which also is stupid. People are paying you guys their hard earned money and you can't even stay up to date with the latest api changes? Doesn't make sense. Error messages are vague and don't offer any idea as to what is actually wrong. \"There is a problem with the applet\" IS NOT HELPFUL... On a brighter side, the ones that do work work well, and the UI is intuitive and well designed. 3 stars.","This subscription annual cost is out of touch with reality. Used this app long time ago, came back to use it again and now there is a large pay wall.

Does not work well with Lenovo USI pen and Lenovo Chromebook Duet. USI pens supposed to have like 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity. Problem faced by most people with Lenovo USI pen & Chromebook duet is, even before pen tip touches the screen, it already leaves \"ink-marks\" on the screen. Writing & drawing is impossible. Not sure where is the problem, Lenovo's USI pen or application not able to handle such high pressure sensitivity.","The one feature I want it for, drawing on PDF's, is a premium option that you can't test out to make sure it actually works. I've tried 3 other apps and none of them worked so why would I spend money on this if I don't KNOW that it worked.","Squid is a great app for writing notes and writing on PDFs. However, that's all the app does well, and even that will cost you. There is no organization of notes whatsoever. No search bar, no tags, no folders.","I loved the app after I made a purchase for the parts I needed, now I find out that the payment I thought was once off was only for a month's use of the functionality to write on PDF's. When making this purchase there is no indication that this purchase is for a limited time only. Can't believe I paid like $7 to write on PDF for only a month!","Great app for taking notes, but the imported images are blurry, super low res. If you try to crop them in-app, for some reason the image goes back to being high quality, but in the note itself the image is super bad. You can't read text within images because the text shows up as low res nonsense."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.steadfastinnovation.android.projectpapyrus","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.steadfastinnovation.android.projectpapyrus&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"TickTick: ToDo List Planner, Reminder & Calendar","description":"🥇Great to-do list app for new Android device - The Verge\r\n🥇The best to-do app for Android - MakeUseOf\r\n🥇The best to-do list app for 2020 - Wirecutter (A New York Times Company)\r\n🙌MKBHD's favorite productivity tool\r\n\r\nTickTick is a simple and effective to-do list and task manager app which helps you make schedule, manage time, stay focused, remind about deadlines and organize life at home, work and everywhere else.🗓 🔔 ✔\r\n\r\nTickTick helps you make the most of your day and get things done (GTD).

It's feature-rich and complex in a good way! It has a way to do everything I've wanted to do with it so far. And the restrictions for free users are VERY reasonable. I'll probably upgrade to the paid version soon, as it has already made many aspects of my life easier and I've only been using it for a week or so. Very highly recommend.","It's a nice app as far as the features are concerned but I'm finding it difficult to navigate and manage habits (despite the brand new update). I'm trying to delete a habit with no success and I don't feel the app has a sleek, clean or attractive look to it. Instead it feels cumbersome and not easy to manage. I'm also having problems adding tasks; the plus mark (+) doesn't always work when I click on it.","Simply the best reminder app I have ever used. I plan my life using this app. I lose track of time quickly and hours can go by without realizing. I use the desktop app, which pops up a notification on both laptop and phone, and I'm always on my laptop for work. I have repeating dailies that pop up at specific times to tell me when to eat lunch, take my meds, take a short break, go for my daily walk, etc. I cannot express how helpful this app is. I wish I'd found it sooner and I wish I could give it more stars. Thank you for creating it and please don't ever stop developing it.","If you're looking for a focus timer as well as place that arranges all your tasks, TickTick is just the one app you need. Earlier, I had separate apps for timers and to-do lists, but TickTick offers the best of both to you! It's the perfect app for students! Check it out!","Every morning, I start my day with TickTick. I review my work schedule (changes a lot), my habits (work out, learn guitar), my recurring tasks (clean, cook, laundry) and my big projects (home repair, moving, job search).

However, the latter does NOT belong under the heading 'What's New'! I'm sure I'm not the only one who actually reads the 'What's New' section, which other Devs manage to use to communicate with (potential) users re new/enhanced features, issue/stability fixes, etc.","I really like the concept and idea behind this app. The one thing I don't like is the stop of my audio when I open the app while listening to music. This may because of the ads 😅. I do not mind the banner ads since they don't interfere with my doing but I don't like the pop ups. For better earning I think it's better to make an ad to unlock a certain feature. Like I want to make use a VIP template. Maybe I can unlock by watching an ad. If I want to use the template again I gotta unlock again.","I like this app better than the regular one, but this app you have to pay for items. It's not free as advertised. There are many things you can due for free, but most of everything else comes with a subscription. Which is $29.99 for life!! Not bad right??? Well everything I want to use like auto save, auto back up, and many other similar things all have to be done on a subscription. Which at this very moment today I can't pay for. Not today anyways. It does have some nice features!!","It's an ok app, although most of the features are only available for VIP members, & there are more ads than I'd prefer. Overall it's not horrible, but you might be able to find better, simpler note-apps out there ☺️","This app is the worst.. I created notes on it , it had pictures also. I worked so hard when it was created finally, I tried to share the assignment with teacher, but guess what ... It said you can only share text, or picture or snapshot ... It said to upgrade to premium to make the pdf My whole hardwork was wasted..

I frequently use it for my weekly shopping, but also for deciding what movies to watch with the kids, and tasks/chores needed in the house. Sharing the list makes it easy to manage shopping (or chores) across multiple people. Highly recommended. The one con is the premium version is only offered as a subscription. I would be far more comfortable simply buying a lifetime license.","I bought the premium version so that I could share the list with my whole family. The convenience of us all having the list & being able to add things & take things off when purchased is great. My only complaint is that even though I bought the premium version, I'm still the only person out of the 5 of us who can add pictures to go with items on the list. That's not time saving or convenient for me. I'm still having to flip back to a pic that one of my teens texted me & the list until I add it.","This app is brilliant, and my boyfriend and I are always trying to talk other couples or roommates into getting it. It's easy to use, it's fun to add things while someone else is shopping because you can see by what items are crossed off, what sections of the store they haven't been to yet. We have premium and enjoy the recipe importation, even though it's slightly finnicky. Being able to put a photo of the item on the list is a bonus, too!","This app has really helped my menu planning and grocery shopping become a fun factor in my day. What makes it really fun is sharing with my sister-in-law (we both subscribe) and reading her comments on recipes and seeing what is on her grocery list and other shard lists. This app has a lot of great features the best of which is being able to filter grocery lists in multiple stores and categorizing and arranging them by location to each store. And much more.","I installed this app and paid for the family premium after seeing that when I add grocery items, it automatically categories and categories, when I tried to create a different list, that didn't happen. I think they do it simply to trick us to upgrade but after you've upgraded then you realize there's nothing more explore.

But recent updates are full of bugs. Pathetic. My documents could not be saved. Each time I tried to save the app would crash. Finally to get rid of the problem I uninstalled the app and in the process lost all my precious files. In my newer device which serves as a secondary device I also faced similarly strange issues. In this case, could not press enter or space, it mashed together words and deleted blocks of texts.","It was fairly good when I first got it, but now it's glitching a lot with the text when I try to write; it randomly will mash words in the middle of other words. Also... A subscription? Really?","I would have given it 5 stars before the latest update but now parts of the program don't seem to work. Like being able to change the line spacing on documents, every time I try to it shuts down without saving anything so I have to then start over. Also when I'm typing the words they will all of a sudden cut off other words so I have to end up undoing stuff which can seriously sucks as well. If they could work on that for the next update I'll see about updating the number of stars.","This app is good in UI. But it is pathetic when I am trying to use it. It is taking unusual delay/time (and often crushed) when I try to launch it. Please look into this matter.","Extremely disappointed in the recent forced shift to All Access permissions requirement. Now several years of files are lost, unable to be viewed without allowing this app to access, change, and delete any and all files with NO notice on my devices. I know the standard response from the developers is mostly a polite \"too bad, that's just how it is now due to Android OS 11\", but this is terrible.

It's THAT GOOD!! ☮️💪🏻💜","Occasionally gets blocked by streaming services but they usually fix it quickly and you can just pop into another server when that one doesn't work. Definitely worth getting the lifetime subscription. I have very rarely run into speed issues.","Very fast and stable VPN.

It does work technically, but won't stay connected if the phone switches to any other app. So every time someone calls, texts, or if another app sends an update, it will require that the phone rescan the QR code from the Elgato software on the PC. That doesn't sound like it would be a bad thing, but if you have a busy cell phone like I do, this amounts to take a minute to reset it about 10 times every hour. Who needs that kind of aggravation? It's so sad: this could have been such a home run for Elgato. I'm such a Stream Deck fanboy, I really thought this would have been as stellar as the rest of Elgato's A+ products. Instead I got unserviceable software that is way too impractical to use. I'm out the price of a yearly subscription that I can't use. Sorry Elgato: you need to fix this before you try to sell a subscription based service.","SCREEN BURN WARNING!!!! I noticed it once before but by restarting my phone (Note 10) it seemed to have disappeared, but after tonight's stream (usually go for 2-2.5 hours), there's a faint burn that I'm hoping might dissipate with some time; however, I'm canceling my subscription. Like many others, I've also experienced a lot of connection issues and having to add a new device several times. Great idea, and I've liked it while it has worked, but this is going to ruin a lot of phones!!!!","Be aware, my subscription is cancelled on the app store but the payments are still being taken out every month. When I try and access the app it want me to apply a new subscription yearly or monthly and my existing one doesn't exist. Can't cancel my original one as yet unless I contact my payment issuer.","Sure it works, but please devs- we all really need you guys to fix the connection issue where every time I open the app anew I have to create a new connection with my computer, resulting in having 30+ connections to the same device yet unable to delete any of them 😢 I don't enjoy having a clogged connection list","Loses connection with the desktop app all the time. Works great when it works but if my phone strays from the stream deck app for anything, even notifications, it loses connection and I have to scan the QR again at least 4 times per stream."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.corsair.android.streamdeck","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.corsair.android.streamdeck&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"magicplan","description":"Instantly create and share floor plans, field reports, and estimates with one easy-to-use application. magicplan offers a better way to get work done while in the field. \r\n\r\nMeasuring & Sketching\r\nWe use state-of-the-art tech with an easy-to-use interface, allowing you to measure and sketch interior plans in 2D & 3D.\r\n\r\nReporting\r\nAdd photos, 360° images, notes, custom forms, and markups to create structured reports that eliminate any risk of confusion.\r\n\r\nEstimating\r\nWe developed a way to combine take-off and estimate to automatically calculate pricing on your mobile device.\r\n\r\nmagicplan is renowned worldwide:\r\nDownloaded by over 20 million users\r\nEvery day the equivalent of a small city is mapped with magicplan\r\n \r\nTraining session available in English at https://www.magicplan.app/webinars/\r\n\r\nCan I use magicplan for free?\r\nUsing magicplan for free allows you to experience the full potential of magicplan by giving you access to all features on two projects.

And far as trying to make a layout for a house on here. We're u need to put walls it dos not let u some times. Like it won't let u make a wall off of a inside wall but it will from a out side wall. And y dos it not let u run the walls together? Like some of the inside walls can't be the same size? That's just very crazy to me. If they fix this I thank it will be werth using all the time","So far this app is becoming easier to use each time I log on and the fact that it gives you 2 free designs is even better for you to be able to compare. If they could just allow you to put in the roof pitch or roof angle and select amount of overhang you want so that it places a roof over your design to see if the design works they would have a monopoly on the market because I have not seen an app yet that does this.","It was a great app, but it seems they removed access to the 3D view to the free plans and now it isn't of value you to me anymore. It doesn't make sense for me to get a subscription plan either. I used to recommend it to everyone and now I'm going to find a different app.","\"Aim at your feet\", \"floor too uniform\", \"aim at your feet\"... Never got beyond these messages. Worthless. Just tried again in case it's fixed. Current version doesn't even launch properly without hanging up.","The only thing I don't like is that there are restrictions on objects for no reason. For example, I can't add a bookcase of size 61x242cm. It says bookcase should be less than 200cm. Why? My bookcase is in fact in these dimensions. Also, I was not able to add my dining table because it did not allow my dimensions. Please remove these restrictions, so that it will be a 5-star app."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sensopia.magicplan","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sensopia.magicplan&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"AutoCAD - DWG Viewer & Editor","description":"Take the power of AutoCAD wherever you go!

That's cool, but it REALLY messed up screen recording. First off, the videos seem to automatically be sped up, but the pitch is the same. It also seems to only happen sometimes. There's also a glitch with the audio where it sounds like it's coming out of a fan - well, that's the best way I can describe it. And the audio glitch happens every time. As an amateur video editor who needs to screen record for my videos, this is incredibly annoying. Usually it's great, tho.","This app is really great, its sound quality and video quality is really very good.The thing I like most is that you can put a logo of your choice instead of the recorder logo, it's really great.","The random stopping time seems to be fjxed. A new bug I noticed is it will close by itself. I'll be looking for the red circle but it closed itself for some reason. Another minor bug is the audio will be distored when I start recording. Thank you.","I use mobizen 2 years now and most annoying about this app is the watermark! I tried to watch video,after I finish seing two videos I cant open another videos!

I had been using the wireless display option all the time. Paid the one time cost to enable pro features. Now the wireless display changed to subscription-based. This is not what I paid for. Greed has gotten this app to go from being the best to simply one of many making the money grab with subscriptions. How utterly disappointing.","This is a very cool concept, just plug your device into your computer and creates a monitor. On their website it says it can run at 60 fps, which would be awesome if it were true. With my Tab s5e, I am getting around 10-20 fps. I would say this app is a scam, but it is probably a bug, and it's at least usable despite the lag, and I contacted the support team, which were very responsive and respectful. However they could not address the issue. Until they fix the issue, I am giving them 3 stars.","Cool product, better tech support. I bought this while on vacation, had a few problems with speed. Sent an email to the dev/support and got a response very quickly. He led me through some debugging / troubleshooting steps and we finally figured out that the wi-fi where I was staying was too far away (and sub-standard). After I got home, I tried it again and it works like a charm. Thank you for getting this to work, I can see it being very helpful while traveling (to locations where I have decent internet).","I really like the idea of this app. I have all Apple products EXCEPT my Galaxy Tab S7+, simply because the Galaxy Tab is much better bang for buck, and I think just a better experience than iPad. That being said, Duet was supposed to be the app that allowed my to use my tablet as a second screen and even for drawing. But it works so poorly. I didn't even notice a difference using a wired connection. I'd pay extra to get stylus support if it worked. But it's so laggy and unreliable. Please fix.","An absolute nightmare to keep working. When it works, everything runs great besides some minor lag when drawing in apps such as photoshop. However I literally can never get it to work despite paying for the premium subscription. I got the air to connect only one single time. Half the time it won't connect be cause \"my subscritpion was canceled\" yet I have the money taken out of my account.

This app has been so helpful! The little hits of dopamine from accomplishing tasks and earning points is exactly what my neurodivergent brain needs. It's cute, it's easy to use. I was able to input all my chores, even annual ones! And input habits I want to encourage or discourage like getting takeout versus eating at home. It glitched on me once. I just closed the app, reopened it, and it was fine! It's a free app! I plan to subscribe if this ADHDer still uses it in September. ;)","I love the concept and really want to use the app, however, I don't want my to-do list items to disappear once completed. They need to go into a space for \"tasks completed\" or something similar, so that they can be referenced if necessary. I will have to use a different checklist until this is possible.

I also love how the free version doesnt withhold the basics, and subscription isnt forced [although once I have the money I definetly will be!] The wheelchair option in the avatar is super cool aswell. could never rate it anything other than 5 stars!","Good concept but seems a bit buggy so far. The positive/negative setup is not the most intuitive thing to figure out, as well as some other features. While trying to initially set up my tasks, I tried to adjust the streaks, and it would not save my adjustment. So idk. The app could use some more QA I think, & maybe some work on UX? Hoping it all gets better over time. The character creation is cute and I like the reward aspect of it.","This is actually a great app and I find it motivates me to do the things I struggle to do on a daily basis way better than any other methods I've tried. However one really annoying thing is that if you leave the app running in the background and come back to it, none of your tasks will load.

My very first task is a fail and the app will be deleted. I need a daily reminder every WEEKDAY, not every single day. This app doesn't seem to offer that, at least not easily. I need an app that it intuitive and efficient, and this simply isn't it. Too bad, I had high hopes. I can't say much about an app that lasted all of a few minutes, but I doubt that I'm alone in needing to list repetitive tasks that follow a routine","I paid for the premium version and I'm deleting this app. I wrote many times to the app makers but never had a reply. I sent them lots of screenshots. This app is too buggy and feels unstable. The last straw was one of my repeat To Do's with sub categories has turned into 10 subcategories that say 'car wash', and all my other subcategories have now gone. It's infuriating. You can't charge for a premium service for something so buggy. Not happy at all.","The app is somewhat neat and elegant. Not overloaded, which is good in the world of \"todo apps\". However. The first sin is the \"add task\" notification, which is a common task apps abuse. Notifications are for notifying. With this thing on you'll never have this \"done clearing notifications\" feeling again (and isn't regaining control over things to do the purpose of every todo app?). (Yes, you CAN turn it off.) Second sin is that the category color isn't used anywhere, so it's basically useless.","(Updated from 3 stars): Stunning and optimised 👍 I would highly recommend it In terms of task ordering, is there a way of getting them to appear in order from top to bottom rather than bottom to top? Previous problem (which I awarded 3 stars for, now fixed): 1/6 chance the 'press and hold to reorder task' feature would work ie: Display the border surrounding the task and allow me to move the task. This wasted lots of time.","I understand having ads but I have been trying to adjust something and every time I click its like there is an ad. I used a list and sublist and it seemed to copy the first item all the way down the list. I'm finding a new app. When I first used the app I enjoyed it.

The app is not at all intuitive, I found it hard to navigate through it and somehow, after several days of use, I still have no idea how to mark stuff as done (for habits that I set for myself, without reminders). 🤷🏻‍♀️ Pity, because it looked really good in the beginning, and seemed to be what I needed.","Great app for tasks! I've only downloaded it today, and I already have most of my tasks done! This app has no bugs whatsoever, and I love the software. It's smooth, and it looks nice to me. There are so many reminders/habits that you can easily hand pick from the options given. Like sleeping, online studying, and so much more! As a student, this reminder app will definitely help me a lot with tracking tasks and more. The app has so much more to offer than you think, download it now! I love it!","Looks great - Sneaky & Annoying popups. Signed up for free, 1st thing you see is the 7 day free trial and it asks for CC #...you DON'T have too do this to use it, look for little X in corner that you can barely see. I feel many don't see this X and think you must do 7 day trial to use it free. SNEAKY tactic, making X-out so hard to notice. EVERY time you open app to use it they use this method of pop up to try and get you to subscribe. ANNOYING. Looks great, and fun to use, not user friendly","It's a nice app! I got the paid version and there are some things I'd like to see added: A way to add descriptions to some routines An explanation for how the weekly routines are calculated-I'm supposed to do something 3x a week but it stops counting when the weekend arrives A way to set our own times for morning/afternoon/evening More icons for routines (maybe emojis?) I've also had some notifications not showing up for some reason (in the evening)","I m not satisfied at all. I got the one year premium.

There is no break even point if you do premium, you will always be down, it's just math. Anyways after 3 months straight (not a single day not mining) I'm up to $0.49 if that sounds worth it to you, great. There are other apps like BTC cloud 2021 where you can make literally 100x that, though the mining is more hands on.","Real payout ! fun reward system , lots of ads. You get 2 or 3 spins and if you wish more, you have to watch an ad. But don't order your Lambo just jet; you get 10 to max 100.000 Litoshi (still only 0,1% when you already hit the litecoin logo twice) After 1 day casually playing i got about Litoshi or about 7 eurocents (at current rate).

They immediately responded here and via email to my issue of not being able to activate the service. Not many companies can say that! They were quick, precise, and gave me clear instructions for how to get setup and use their vm app. I was able to fix it and love this app! One of my absolute favorites for functionality w my phone. You guys are awesome! Great job developers! Update after 4 months: One Big issue: empty vm count towards free 10 per month.","I use the free version (10 transcripts/month, 1 personalized greeting). It serves my needs well. I've used it for about a year and have not had any issues. I get an email with the transcription and also have the voice recording and transcription in the app as well. The few times I exceeded the transcription limit, I could still listen to the recording. I recommend this app.","So helpful! I hate having to dial into my vm and remember what buttons do what. Voxist puts it right there so I can see it, delete it, and/or call back with ease. Quick and easy to set up too. Sometimes the dictation will horribly mistype words or phrases, which is my only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.","I do like this app but set up isn't easy. My house doesn't have great reception so I need VoLTE and WiFi calling on so I get clearer reception. However, with VoLTE and WiFi calling on, it just doesn't work. Nobody can leave a voicemail, and it plays a French message. If it can work with VoLTE, it would be perfect. Doesn't work with 3 mobile.","I've been enjoying the app. It does what it is supposed to do. The only reason I took away 2 stars is because I keep getting alerts that I have a new voicemail transcript but when I open the app it says \"no transcript available\" and this counts against the 10 free transcriptions. Why does that count against my free transcripts if there was nothing to transcribe? Other than this, I love the app."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.voxist.vm.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.voxist.vm.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"BlackBerry Hub+ Services","description":"BlackBerry Hub+ Services is the foundation upon which all of your favorite BlackBerry applications are built.

The point of the Hub is a unified Inbox, so I'm disappointed that I may have to drop the app. I've written to support, and am awaiting the reply. Brilliant app that blows away its competition. I have 10 email accounts + social media. Blackberry's rightly famous Hub lets me deal with this barrage of messaging very efficiently on phone & tablet.","I'm now on a OnePlus 8 Pro. I've never been on a phone that wasn't a BlackBerry. Hub+ is well worth the subscription and i have never had any issues with the transition. People that give poor reviews because they are on outdated phones isn't fair. I'm on Android 11 where my keyone was on 8. Yes it was giving me issues before but sometimes you just have to let go of the nostalgia of a BlackBerry and update your phone. This app works very very well and there is no other app like it.","On BB Motion Some emails do not appear in hub at times. Also, Yahoo mail used to blink red LED and now blinks blue (which is same color as texts). Oulook also blinks blue. Gmail, which I do not normally use now blinks red. We should have control of these LED notifications like older BB10 used to let user select.","Installed android 10 phone my previous phone Keyone android 7 had glitches ...sometimes unable to receive emails..sometimes for 24 hours..Since on android 10 (not a BB or keypad which requires re-learning) fast and reliable Hub Services,,,","Great app. I have become so used to this app on my Blackberry Keyone that I wanted it on my TCL 20 Pro 5G.

Yes, we don’t follow any stereotypes here. So in this release, we want to thank all the women who tirelessly and continuously work to make NordPass a better password manager. ","comments":["It's getting better. One thing I hate is being forced logged out. Look, I get it safety and security. On a phone or laptop fine. But let me make that choice. Having to log in every day on my home desktop computer? Total PITA.","Okay but has issues. Tried this service because of their amazing vpn service that I would highly recommend but this autofill app has a ways to go before I could recomend. I have an active subscription currently and I cannot export passwords but has the option to import password only. Sometimes the autofill option doesnt like to work but for the most part it does what it is suppose to do. Keep up the work and it will be a great app.","Just excellent! And how anyone does anthing online without this app, is beyond me hehe. Love it and highly recomend it. Once you try it out, you will never understand how you manage without xD","It keeps unapplying itself in the permissions to auto fill. Furthermore autofill is a huge drag using this app even in the paid version. I hope this will be patched out People don't want to break their back to access passwords in this ever increasing speedy world of using different devices and different passwords. Developers please make ease of access better. If this doesn't change I probably will be shopping around for something else.I would love to keep this though. I like the rest.","I find this app a little frustrating. When I open an app the Nordpass icon pops up I click on it & most times it turns the screen misty white color & does nothing.

App won't move to adoptable storage and I definitely don't have room to store email internally. Looked promising otherwise and such a simple thing spoils it. This is so easy and no reason not to do so. With modern fast SD the speed penalty is usually not noticable. Yes, many apps are guilty of the same thing, that doesn't make it right. The only way I can make space on my device is to delete other apps I use also guilty of this. Not one more!","I've only used this app for a short time, but so far, it works as advertised. That said, all I want is a reliable way of collecting my email, and sending the occasional letter out while away from my computer. I'm hoping that this app doesn't get in the way of that through marketing or feature bloat. So far, my limited experience with this app has been good.","Many parts are cool in theory, but the flaws far outshine the positive aspects. Here are some of the major issues: 》You can create folders for organizing your inbox, but cannot set any rules for how items get sorted into said folders 》Folders other than your main inbox do not refresh, show unread #, or show search results 》About 10% of the time, the app will randomly start reading my emails allowed. Closing the app in multitasking doesn't stop it & it's not my device settings. Full dealbreaker.","Awesome, absolutely a breeze to use. I have multiple email accounts and need different settings for each one, which I can easily do through this app. I have no complaints at all after several months of using it now. There's small glitches that can happen here and there but due to the app being so good, u truly overlook the small little glitches!!!!","I did try quite a few of email clients, and happy to give 5stars to this one. Early days of use, and quite a few functionality in app, still exploring all settings, but looks quite clean, functional and simple to use. Will see in future if anything is not right for me. For now, would strongly recommend to anyone who is in need to manage multiple email accounts in one place!

Saves me so much time and let's you do other things while listening to documents instead. The only issue I have with it right now is the need of a \"Set header and footer for all pages\" button. Or even a \"No header and footer button\" so that it reads all of the page. Unless I'm misunderstanding and setting the header and footer for one pages sets it for all of them. I don't think it does because I've still had it skip lines sometimes. Overall great 👍","I am a paid 1 month subscriber . I was foolish because I use this service . Because I wasted my money because I can't use natural reader inside any mobile browser ( including kiwi browser NR don't work) and now I realised that Text to speech is free inside microsoft edge mobile and Plus browser with very very high quality and it's completely free in edge","I've had this app for almost two years now and has been so helpful HOWEVER, it is very glitchy and will no longer play on my phone (for almost two weeks now) I've refreshed it, reported it, and uninstalled it and reinstalled it with no luck. I really can't afford to pay for something that no longer works :( *update, problem was mostly fixed by synching the phones internal clock. It still randomly refreshes in the middle of talking sometimes but it's usable now.","Gave this a try after testing out their Chrome extension on the desktop. Not a big fan of subscription software, but wondered whether this could beat @Voice Aloud Reader (which is free or a one off purchase to remove ads), which I've used for years. Well, what a disappointment this app is. You can't send pages to it to be read. You have faff about copying the text from one app (eg browser) and then paste it into the app. The app also requires an Internet connection to convert the text to speech. Compare this to @Voice Aloud Reader which: uses system voices that can be installed locally, reads web pages directly (and allows you to load pages in an inbuilt browser if you need to login to a paywall), adds a menu to the default selected text menu to read selected text in other apps, allows you to queue up a list of things to read. The list goes on and on. You must have a very niche use case (eg the take a picture for OCR) to use this app over the others out there.","Honestly I would like a refund for my subscription. The app stop playing every other page or so. Also the pronunciation options do not work at all I've put in multiple ones and they are just ignored. If those two features actually worked on a regular basis, I would probably get this four or five stars."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.naturalsoft.personalweb","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.naturalsoft.personalweb&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Aloha Browser Turbo - private browser + free VPN","description":"Aloha Browser is a fast, free, full-featured web browser that provides maximum privacy and security.\r\n\r\n 🌎 FREE Unlimited VPN: taking your Internet freedom and security to the next level\r\n ⛔️ AD BLOCK, Popup block: surf in an ad free environment\r\n 🙈 PRIVACY and tracking protection: we don’t log any of your activity and will never share it with anyone, because we have nothing to share.

I pay a monthly subscription fee for all features of Xodo and I use it every day. So I wasn't very happy that Xodo required complete access to my device's file system as well as cloud services without any guardrails. However, they recently updated to give users the ability to choose which files to allow Xodo to access. Love it! Thanks for being a responsive company and dev team!","I've been using this app for months now, and it functions well, no bugs or whatever that interrupts you from what you are doing in the app. One of the best things about this is that, it doesn't have any ads nor have any distractions. And the worse thing about this app is that the \"Reading Mode\" feature doesn't seem to be pleasing for reading because the letters are not arrange perfectly... Please fix it :))","This is a great free pdf viewer. Every feature works nearly flawlessly, if a little slow every now and again. My biggest complaint, and what kept me from giving a 5 star review, is that in order to get the Pro version, you have to pay a subscription. A one time fee would be plenty understandable, but unless you are providing new content regularly, a subscription for a mostly static app, in terms of features and content, is just ridiculous and insulting. These companies need to get it together.","Pages turn black all of a sudden. I have to exit the app and again open it in order to fix this and also when I add pages they randomly add on a different page rather than the selected page. When I try to zoom in on something important again the entire page becomes black. I get frustrated by this all the time. Please fix this.","New update which makes the draw function unuseable kills the app. You write one letter and it highlights the letter to change it's size. You have to unclick it by tapping the page to write another letter. Useless for talking notes just because of that. But the line is thicker now too for some reason. Inane, app killing update from an app which used to be fine."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.xodo.pdf.reader","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xodo.pdf.reader&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"WinZip – Zip UnZip Tool","description":"Get the world’s #1 zip file opener on Android!

Sub Rosa Pro for Android includes all of the same great features as Sub Rosa for Android with added support for 3rd party readers (any USB reader that shows up as a CCID device) and derived credentials.<br> <br>Sub Rosa Pro for Android is a strong, two-factor CAC/PIV secure authentication agent and web browser that smoothly coordinates reader and card access on your Android phone or tablet.

Also, it would be really cute if animals could roam in the forest so that the forest won't feel so empty hehehe! Hope you can consider this in the next updates but nevertheless, I'm happy with this app. 😊","After switching to a new phone, it doesn't allow me to restore my pro account. It keeps sending errors 601, 599, 61, 600 ect. I don't know what they all mean. I guess it only allows you to use pro account on one device. And if you loose that device, you can't restore your account again","I love this app!! It's easy to use and not too complicated. It's simply what I was looking for. It would have been even better if there was a feature in which we can customise our forest. Like for example move the plants to where we prefer and design the forest accordingly our preference. But this app is more than brilliant. Love it!","Does exactly what it should! You can monitor how you spend your time with the tags and it's nice to see your forest grow. Premium is very affordable and I honestly think it is worth it to support this app. Great job Forest!","To start, yes it lets u grow little trees during time, but everything else you have to pay real money for. The cute trees is shows in the pictures, real money, the planting real trees, real money, the friends part, real money. And the basic trees you get at the beggining all cost coins which u get for studying certain amounts of time. And half of them dont change or grow so its just a tree/item sitting there while u study.

It allows me to add notes when skipping or completing tasks that I can view in a log. As I'm using it to manage my mental health it has been great of showing me where and when I am struggling. I like the functionality that you can skip tasks but have them keep reappearing until complete and it helps me with doing household tasks when my function is down.","Best free app I've ever seen.❤️ It have so many features that I love. It's graphics are so pretty🥰 It's easy to use and it motivates me to complete the tasks. And I like to say if we can put the importance of the task to it(like red for most important, yellow for medium & green for less important) i think it is very easy to manage the time... It's just a idea and THIS APP IS PERFECT ☺️","I have been using a similar app for quite a while (\"our home\"). I rely on it for my housework. I was considering change it. Your app looks promising but lacks of the crucial feature I need in order to use it. I can not set a regular task to be repeated after some days I have actually done it. E.g. let's say i clean my bedroom every three days. If I skip a day is not big deal, but I want to clean it 3 days after I have actually done it. With your app there is no similar option for this thing.","Using this for injury recovery exercises, having previously used a simpler app that was getting a bit tedious to track. I tried out a few other habit tracking apps and Tusk is easily the most practical and at least compared to the others, has a more intuitive interface. Also I contacted them about 5 days ago about some little UI changes and they seemed to have come through today quietly, and very much appreciate them. Will be subscribing today! 💃💃","This is a great task app. I love the way it handles things I have to do (e.g. take meds) with things I'd like to do but maybe don't have to done that day (e.g. Clean bathroom). I also like that it supports habits and goals (like working out 3 days/week) without being obnoxious or nagging. I don't get shamed if I skip a task today. I would like the ability to make a task every Friday, but have it stay in my list until complete, and once complete set it up again for the next Friday."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.ulsoft.tusk","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ulsoft.tusk&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Easy Voice Recorder Pro","description":"Easy Voice Recorder Pro is your everyday companion to record important moments.

I did not know about the pro and when I found out about it I got it right away. I love the fact that it goes into a cloud and that way it frees up space on my phone and I don't have to worry about downloading anywhere else to protect it. You can use it for lectures, meetings etc. It will literally record for hours mine has gone as long as 22 hrs. I left it on by accident but you can edit with pro so it's great. Also you pay 1 time ot goes with your phone #.","Perfect in every way I've ever needed it, in function AND form. I've used other similar programs over the years, okay quality, but free trials end and blah blah blah... Everything is easy to use and store and share, and the quality is good. Really glad I just went ahead and paid the handful of dollars for the straight-up Pro edition, now I'm ready to grab any idea for my music anywhere, across like three of my devices","Best decision to buy this app. & no I didn't get paid for this...I'm autistic so I like to say it as I see it. It was good with the free version & I never had any glitches on my phone but when I decided to upgrade. Let's all admit that the price is not big. People spend that much money on a coffee. Anyway the free version was good but the very affordable price of the pro will be the best move ever. 1st you get a cool app with heap's (& I do mean) heap's of very cool features. Best move ever!!","A concise, flexible, easy to use recorder that I also double as a way to store my music. My only wish was that it came with a shuffling feature other than just reorganizing things by different categories like name or file size.

Without this annoyance i'd say its a great app.","I am a paid user for 10 months.. everything works fine n I plan to renew my subscription until 3 days ago... all my past ten months of event records were gone suddenly..and planner pro can't do anything to help to get back 10 months of event data. Totally disappointed with this app and will stop my renewal. I won use it even for free. I did contacted u guys n exchanged a few emails. Seems to me there is nothing u guys can do to help.","I am a Franklin Covey planner user and I finally found an app to replace the basic functionality here on my phone. Great app and worth the full price to eliminate advertisements. It also syncs with my Microsoft family calendar, and Samsung and Google calendars.","Use to be my favorite app of all time but now I can't make any events on the planner unless I have another calendar app. What's the point of using planner pro if I have a different calendar app? Not being able to make events takes away half of the reason to have this app.","I love the idea of this however when I log an all day event it goes over into the next day which makes it very annoying so I am unable to use.

The design isn't as aesthetic as before and I can't feel the 'minimalist' theme of it now. I liked the old font more and the friendly design. Also, the logo at the opening screen is... Somehow irritating to the eyes because it's stretched too much and the background is just white. Numerous features that used to be free before are behind the pay wall now as well... I've been using this app for years now but I guess it's time to uninstall.","I used to love this app - it was my primary tool for writing on my Chromebook. Unfortunately I can no longer recommend it as with every new update comes new bugs. I've lost countless hours of work due to crashes and even more lost due to saving glitches. It used to be so minimal and fast, now it suffers from constant input lag and just feels like a totally different piece of software. Canceled my Pro subscription and moving on.","Don't waste your time! I've been using Jotterpad for a couple of months daily and even paid for the subscription to use cloud storage. I have lost about 4 days work of writing from this awful app from the auto save feature never working, the cloud storage overwriting my new work and when I contacted support in tears, they took multiple days to respond and then never bothered helping in the end. Waste of money, waste of time and too much heartache if you care about your work. Awful app.","Used to be great, but now it auto-formats as I type and there's no option to turn it off. Can't tell you how maddening it is to erase one letter at the start of a paragraph and have that whole entire paragraph jump up a line to smash up against the prior paragraph in a horrible text wall. There's other issues, like how the formatting is so broken that I can't read text files written in an old version of Jotterpad (which worked FINE) and have to open them in an entirely separate app. Pretty bad!","I cannot believe after all these years JotterPad still doesn't have an application for Windows. This is just crazy to me. I would gladly leave IA Writer and pay for the option to sync across all of my devices. Because while I prefer the JotterPad writing experience and its beauitful UI, IA Writer syncs across all of my devices. Admittedly, JotterPad is better in every other way. However, convenience is huge. I'll be back when JotterPad has Windows application so I can write from my computer."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jotterpad.x","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jotterpad.x&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Tunity : Hear any muted TV","description":"JOIN TUNITY PRO TO SKIP ALL THE ADS - try it now and get one week free!

I have loved it. Yesterday I did an update and thought I had lost everything. I spoke to customer service today, they were awesome! So kind and helpful. It took a little bit but he was able to figure out the problem. So greateful to have everything restored. Just a side note it was not their fault but my error. So glad they could find the problem. All is well. I would highly recommend this app.","*updating review. I emailed customer support and they fixed the bug. You guys are awesome!!! Thank you!!!! I got a new phone and I can't log in anymore. I usually log in through Facebook and it's not working. Please fix or let me know how to fix it. I have been using for a long time and have a lot of clients info I need to recover!!!","This is a brilliant appointment scheduling app. Struggled to find one that's so adaptable to any type of business activity one is engaged in. I so wish it had a dark mode similar to the Google and other calendar apps, and having different colours that one can use on the dark mode. The white display can be a bit much in the evenings. Plus, for Samsung OLED phones, dark modes save battery power. Dark mode gets my 5 stars. Thank you developers for this awesome app. Regards","Great system, a long way to go to master it though. Needs many improvements. Eg, coupon codes added at checkout not at payment at checkout out in your articles. Coupons and discounts for individual or all services. Longer SMS messages to 4 x or more the current amount of space. Include click able links in Reminder Sms for redirects. More than one Reminder SMS, 48hrs and 24hrs. Change appearances Include colour change. Custom forms, tick boxes, other information and longer questions.","I have been using the app for about 3 weeks now and really enjoy it! I would love to be able to add buffer times for travel services to allow time to travel, also, I would like to allow clients to book services for 2 or more clients in one transaction,( ex. 2 clients for makeup services)."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.adaptavant.setmore","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adaptavant.setmore&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Blur=Passwords+Wallet+Privacy","description":"*NEW: Auto-Login for Chrome and Android Apps!*\r\n\r\nWith the new version of Blur for Android, your saved accounts can auto-fill when visiting websites in your Chrome browser, AND when logging in to other Android Apps.

Auto fill menus never persist for more than a couple seconds, making it difficult to auto fill passwords. Auto-fill overlay is way more trouble than it's worth to use. Tech support just tells me it's in beta and that yes, it doesn't work very well. It has been in beta since I've been using the service - around 2 years, with no obvious changes in functionality.","Fantastic privacy suite. EDIT: Unfortunately over time my experience with this app has proven to be rather painful. The app is pretty good on iPhone but on Android, this app leaves a lot to be desired. The auto-fill overlay, even properly configured with accessibility permissions, is unreliable at best. On top of that, there is no option to check my Blur Email Inbox or set up custom named emails like I can on the desktop website. Missing key features. Still a good privacy suite; app needs work.","Downloaded for the masked cards functionality and I love it! Comes in handy when you want to sign up for another company's \"trial period\" but don't want to give out your actual card info. In the end, even at the cost of a premium Blur subscription, I wil end up saving a lot of money over the next year with all the trials I don't get charged for simply because I failed to go back in and cancel on time.","I have been using Blur for many years and it's excellent. It just keeps getting better over time because they keep adding new features. If you care about privacy and security, you should definitely try it.","I love the functionality and options. I don't need to use them all, but the ones I do I use regularly, and prefer living with this resource than without. I subscribe annually and whenever I've had issues I get prompt communications and resolutions. This app is a refined version of the original web service, which had a different name. I found value in the service even back then, and this version is notably improved, primarily with the availability of this app. This is my longest review

You can't control the dimmer. So im here with the lights on trying to set the alarm and I can't read ANYTHING! I would have to turn off my light to see anything. You should be able to adjust this. Also setting the date. If i had a alarm for December and now it's February it still has it on December. So I have to set up a new alarm ugh just talking about it is annoying. Im downloading a different appt.","I use to love this app. But the noisy ads are way too much. It scares my partner every time I go to set an alarm at night. And it annoyingly wakes him up in the morning when I go to use the app. I'm going to just attempt to use my phones built in alarm system. I'm really sad because this was my favorite app to use for my ADHD. I'm fine with ads but they need to be silent for this kind of app.","This WAS a great app, but now I am on the verge of Uninstaller it. Loud ads KILL this app!!!! It is so annoying to have the alarm go off and then have to wait 5 or 10 seconds through an annoying ad before I can shut that off. It especially sucks if you have someone else in the bed with you who gets up later. Yeah, the wife gets pissed off because it wakes her up completely. \"Sorry honey, just waot for the annoying ad with the jackhammer sound then go back to sleep.\" Yeah right. Silent ads are ok","Customer service was fast and good to work with. Still a great program. Thanks for all the help. Dean Love the program. I purchased it a while back and all was good until just recently. It now has ads. The problem is I have 3 Google accounts for different emails and it is looking at 1 that I didn't use to purchase it with. If I delete the account it shows paid. If I add it back it has ads. It didn't use to do this. Any help would be great.","I wanted to really like this app...I even purchased it but it will not prevent my Pixel 4 lock screen from taking over making the app useless.

Sometimes when the remaining time on Strict Mode is getting low, I want to extend it right away before the time is up so that I can avoid being tempted to not turn it back on. Also, I hope Strict Mode disabled only the parts in Settings that are relevant. I need to access wifi settings, for example. The app would be perfect with these features. 🙏","I really like this app! The unpaid version was very limited, but it was obvious that there was potentially a very powerful app, so I upgraded to the Premium version. money well spent. I love that you can creat profiles based on different dependencies (time of day, time limits, location, ECT.) This makes it easy for me to lock down my phone to just for me. I couldnt get enough detail in the any other app (so many of them are just blanket blocking -same restrictions every day.)

Disappointed the desktop backup software has gone (still works and is available elsewhere). Other than that, it's a great backup system. 100gb for free is more than generous and new features appear quite often. There's a decent image search. Would be nice if it could play to Chromecast. It's my replacement for Google Photos now they charge so much.","[Original comment on 18/4/20] I cant download my uploaded file neither from phone or from pc. Whats the point of uploading if you cant even download been trying for weeks nothing has been fixed. Wouldn't recommend anyone to use this app since you can't download uploaded stuff later. [As of 2/8/21] I was promised on email by your representative that I will be able to download but I still can't. Now it says I need to watch an Ad to download my stuff, even after doing that, download fails.","Had been working great UNTIL today, when uploading takes up so much time and the pics are still not uploaded. Also, why isn't there a provision to lock the website with a passcode like the mobile application?","Love the App. Has definitely been a boon in using the free extra space. I would like to recommend a more unique and better way to organize the files. Maybe even have a folder system. 🥂 Cheers","I have never given a below 4 stars rating. Seriously what is the point of uploading when you limit the number of phones that can be linked and you deleted my photos attached to the respective phones when I need to unlink them.

The customer service is awesome, and I will recommend this app to my folks!","I honestly don't usually write reviews but the latest update was so good that I have to sing it's praises. The slicker UI makes navigating the app, which already was good, a breeze. The new agenda features which let me plan ahead, as well as the UI making it a pleasure to use, has made me switch to using this as my main ToDo list. Fantastic! I applaud the team behind such a wonderful app. Keep up the good work!","Really cute note taking app! It's a little confusing at first but well made. It would be nice to have a feature to toggle dark mode/light mode from within the app though. Also, maybe an easier way to delete notes from the main screen! Keep up the good work!","It's still a new app, so features are limited, but I really like it! The functionality it does have works well and I really appreciate the visual customization. Can't wait to see what else the devs have in store for this gem!","Wish I didn't pay for premium.

Allows you to use any audio file as an alarm, but unlike most others, you can set the duration. You can have it repeat the alarm sound until you take the action to stop it or you can set an alarm duration for as short as one second. That means I can set a chime that only plays only once at a certain time every day that reminds me to do something instead of having to silence a repeating alarm sound. That feature alone is worth 5 stars!","Used to be a great app, but they keep adding these cutesy things, like a screan that tells me 'good night' that I have to close instead of just closing the app when I hit the 'Dismiss' button. At least give us a way to turn off these new things when you add them. Or better yet, let us turn them on if we want them. I've used this app for 6 or 7 years now, but I'm now thinking there has to be something better out there.","I've used this app for several years. I have anywhere from 5-12 alarms I use any given day. The most recent update is forcing the \"my dashboard\" to open after every dismissed alarm. I'm already clearing our ads. Now I have another wasted step to my day. I cannot get it to go away and have turned off all settings. I used to love this app but I'm about to switch to another.","I have been using this app for about 10 years now. Recent updates have been painful. I have been taking them into my stride. One of the major issues I have is this: I have 3 or 4 alarms set at the same time. When the alarm notification appears and when I dismiss the topmost alarm - I don't see the remaining alarm notifications..and that is dangerous! If this is not fixed soon, I will be looking for another alarm application.","This was my favorite. I have to wake up at 5am to take a pill but then sleep until I need to get up. The new day popup with a \"good morning \" message blocks the next alarm and I haven't dismissed it on a few occasions which has been terrible. A previous version had allowed me to turn this off but not now. What happened? This has happened to me multiple times. I have a Samsung S8+ and now upgraded to a Samsung S10+. The steps that I have observed on the S8+ (and caused me to be late to work a couple of times) are: 1. I create two alarm clock options: 5am and 6:30am 2. The 5am alarm clock goes off and I dismiss it 3. It displays the \"Good Morning\" message. 4a. If I don't dismiss the \"Good morning\" message closing with the tiny x on the popup after the advertisements are also closed, the 6:30 am alarm doesn't go off. 4b. If I dismiss the Good morning message from the 5am alarm, at 6:30 the second alarm will go off as anticipated. When I discovered this, I found that under Settings> My Day Dashboard, there was a way to turn off the feature entirely. Now that I upgraded to the S10+, the setting is gone. All I can configure is what shows up on the screen. I just tested this on the S10+ with two alarms one minute from each other leaving the Good morning message up, and the second alarm did go off, but I am nervous to depend on it because I have seen it fail. Thank you so much for taking the time to reply. I used to see the two options for \"Show after standard alarm\" and \"Show after quick alarm\" on a previous version on my Samsung S8+, but they are gone since this last update and I tried to run it on my Samsung S10+. When I went back to my S8+, it is now as with the S10+ too. I only have two entries \"My calendar events\" and \"Weather forecast\". I have version 7.0.1 70002976 and I am running on Android version 11.

Simple, elegant and intuitive. I would have paid the premium price just for the basic application and I would change nothing about it. I hope the UI/UX is not altered as well as the app not bloated in the name of providing features. Grateful and Great Job everyone who was a part of this :)","Great app, although it lacks some key features! I will update this review to 5 stars once something close comes out because this app is definitely one of my favorite apps so far. So 2 wishes: 1. I wish there was an option to custom order habits! 2. Wish to better organize categories. Yes there is the option to order by categories, but organizing by colors is extremely clunky. I can see the categories tab being edited so you can drag and reorder categories to what you want","I really like the interface. But one important thing that i feel missing is you can not share your progress with your partner. I won't speak for all but i guess a person to compete with or to follow along does help in completing the habit and task. Is this in development? Or is there anytime soon we would be seeing it ?","This is one of my favourite and most used apps. The new UI was a bit of a shock at first but I'm quickly getting used to it. It's still clear, simple and easy to use and looks really nice. I have one problem now that I did not have before: the font is way too small. I have to increase it drastically in my phone's settings - and then, of course, it's huge in pretty much every other app. That makes HabitNow hard to use for me. Please make the font bigger again or offer in-app font size options.","Good UX design. Quick and easy to add a task to my todo list. I like how the plus button and the option to select a new task are right by my thumb, I don't have to click all over the screen. I'd be interested to see more statistics and features in the settings. I like how minimal the app is, so if they add anything I hope they don't put it in a place that will bloat it, or require extra steps. I like the quick and easy UX.

All the stars are YOU developers ...","I purchased the \"One Time Payment\" version. I have it installed on my One-Plus 8T and love it. I also have on my Samsung Tablet and I'm disappointed. The one feature that I find most useful is the ability to \"Add to Home Screen\" function. This works great on the One-Plus but the option is not there on the Samsung Tablet. I would return the Premium version if I could.","I don't normally do reviews on apps, the app has to be impressive for me to leave a review. This app is awesome. It's easy to understand, easy to navigate and find your document or pictures, etc. No ads in your face so it leaves you alone and I love it a lot. It's never let me down and it doesn't bug me. And it allows me to DELETE my pictures as opposed to google photos. This is a great app. And that is why I am leaving this 5 star review.","Awesome app, makes it very easy and convenient to find things if you're not as technological or tech challenged like alot of people are to find certain types of files especially with a search box right above and gives you a vast array of results to your search not just exactly for what you have searched for.

Same with the ads, they're really well placed to stay visible, but not in the way. We're using the free version for a few months before we upgrade to get a feel for it, but so far it's been amazingly helpful keeping us organized and always coordinated. Since I travel, it helps me avoid traveling over important family dates :)","I got this app when I was diagnosed with cancer. Because of the number of appointments I had I need something where I could put this on one calendar and it would propagate to several people. This app is awesome and worked so well. It made our lives so much easier.","Our family has been using FAMCAL for years. It works well but I have always wished it would finally be available for PC and Mac computers. I'm in the military and work in a building where I cannot bring my phone inside and have to duplicate effort and find work arounds to keep track family calendar events. That disconnect is finally getting to be unworkable. I'll be migrating the whole family over to Cozi Gold because I can access it on my home & work computers and our phones. I hate to do this because I actually prefer FAMCAL's interface and functionality. I know you can run an Android emulator like Bluestacks but not everyone in my family is that tech savvy.","I really enjoy this app it is great for everyone to see what is going on. I really wish you could import other app calendars into it so I don't have to add multiple events in.","Great app. Would have given 5 stars except the home screen widgets sometimes don't update automatically until sync is manually pressed and/or the app is manually opened."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.appxy.famcal","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appxy.famcal&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Do It Now: RPG To Do List.

The app is not super user friendly. If there was any constructive criticism I could add is it would be very helpful if there was a database to get settings achievements, tasks, and rewards out of instead of having to build everything yourself. Also a guideline on how to build things properly with exp and coins. (How much for what tasks).","Really handy and fun way to make to-do lists. I do have a feature request. It would be nice if the inventory of items in possession was separate from the list of all created items. This would make it easier to see what I have in inventory at the moment. Thanks for making this app!","One of the best app on building habits. Unfortunately it's lossing its charm. Please introduce some features in it. Weekly/monthly/yearly Comparison is highly needed to keep ourselves motivated. Time Based /expiring date for unlocking achievements should be introduced. Please bring in these highly desired features.","I believe I that this is the best life rpg app out there. It's clean, intuitive, and very customizable, able to fit a broad range of purposes. My only gripe is the expensive premium, behind which a few features including most icons are. It makes sense, as this is a good quality product and the best of its kind imo, but $18 CAD per year and $58 CAD per full purchase still seem rather steep. Still, it's entirely functional, and there's no need to worry if you don't mind minorly limited aesthetics.","From South Carolina, came to Cali for work this coming month, and now it's like my app doesn't know that. Stuff that I should have all day to complete is auto failing early. I pay monthly for the app and was honestly quite surprised to see it bugging out like this. Whatever app I use for planning needs to be able to be used in more than one time zone. I don't travel much now but I do plan to when I can."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.levor.liferpgtasks","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.levor.liferpgtasks&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Free VPN by FreeVPN.org","description":"FreeVPN is the ultimate VPN.

The free mode with ads isn't a problem and doesn't take that long to get 15h of free VPN, but if I want to add Netflix I have to start the free trial and pay weekly after and I can't do since I'm only 15 which is quite unfortunate😔","It works perfect except on for apps, i downloaded it for Netflix but it doesn't work on apps luckily it does on google and i have no regrets of downloadingthis app 4* Edit: they added a new feature wich lets you pick if you want to use the vpn on netflix now definitely a 5*","I use the app anytime I want to log into Twitter app and I have no problems.

Only thing it's missing is color fill and the magnifying box thingy. Otherwise I'm in love. My brain is kinda scattered so I'm so happy to find an app that goes with my whiteboard/mindmap approach!","I bought the paid version to get a better use of the app, however, I constantly get glitches and delays. I've messaged and sent video proof of these issues and nothing has changed in over a year. I was hoping said problema would be resolved with time in \"the next update\" as they constantly tell me, yet I have the exact same problem than I did last year. If there's any chance of getting a refund I would like to request it as I've tried to deal with the glitches and wait, but this is too much!","I am so sad about this app. I thought I finally found an app that would actually do what I wanted it to, unfortunatly it's crazy bugged!! I wish I had the same experience as everyone else but honestly with the bugs, its insanely hard to use and when you zoom in, the screen goes completely black. I really hope they update it and fix all of the bugs. There is so much potential here!","i see the potential in noteshelf, its a good app when it comes to notetaking and it is still getting better with updates but but but the developers at noteshelf should see the pace at which another app called \"Flexcil\" is moving. flexcil has a ui which feels far far smoother as to what we have seen in noteshelf... noteshelf also has good amount of bugs,the pen sometimes stops working and the app crashes when minimised for too long and the scrolling is sluggish","Overall app is satisfactory, but I'm facing one serious issue right after the new update, when exporting to pdf, the output hand written text becomes automatically too thin and on top of that it even cut down the every few strokes, which ultimately made the text unreadable. Waiting for this bug to be fixed soon. I think it has something to do with compression, because in ealier version pdf sizes were high, but no problem was there."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.fluidtouch.noteshelf2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fluidtouch.noteshelf2&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Mobile Security & Antivirus Free","description":" With trust from over 30 million users worldwide, our award-winning technology provides antivirus and privacy protection, data backup, and phone boosting features.\r\n\r\n\r\n☆ Features\r\n\r\nAntivirus: Professional Local + Cloud engine removes viruses, malware and trojans while scanning downloaded and installed apps in real time for maximum phone protection.\r\n\r\nSafe Browsing: Blocks phishing and malicious websites and ensures a safe online surfing environment.\r\n\r\nAccount Protection: Ensures the safety of your personal accounts\r\n\r\nPrivacy report: Monitors and stops unauthorized accesses to your contacts, messages, location and other private files.\r\n\r\nApp Management: Helps you uninstall unused apps or even useless pre-installed apps (ROOT required) and installation files.\r\n\r\nData Usage Management: Real-time traffic monitor and alert to avoid overuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact customer service at big.cats.feb+support@gmail.com if you have any questions.","descriptionHTML":"<b> With trust from over 30 million users worldwide, our award-winning technology provides antivirus and privacy protection, data backup, and phone boosting features.</b><br><br><br>☆<b> Features</b><br><br><b>Antivirus</b>: Professional Local + Cloud engine removes viruses, malware and trojans while scanning downloaded and installed apps in real time for maximum phone protection.<br><br><b>Safe Browsing</b>: Blocks phishing and malicious websites and ensures a safe online surfing environment.<br><br><b>Account Protection</b>: Ensures the safety of your personal accounts<br><br><b>Privacy report</b>: Monitors and stops unauthorized accesses to your contacts, messages, location and other private files.<br><br><b>App Management</b>: Helps you uninstall unused apps or even useless pre-installed apps (ROOT required) and installation files.<br><br><b>Data Usage Management</b>: Real-time traffic monitor and alert to avoid overuse.<br><br><br><br>Feel free to contact customer service at big.cats.feb+support@gmail.com if you have any questions.","summary":"Protect your phone from viruses and malware with professional antivirus engine.","installs":"10,000,000+","minInstalls":10000000,"maxInstalls":33436465,"score":4.606216,"scoreText":"4.6","ratings":437557,"reviews":130819,"histogram":{"1":11518,"2":5069,"3":24577,"4":61863,"5":334527},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$0.99 - $64.99 per item","size":"20M","androidVersion":"4.4","androidVersionText":"4.4 and up","developer":"Big Cats Studio","developerId":"Big+Cats+Studio","developerEmail":"big.cats.feb+support@gmail.com","developerWebsite":"https://new-nqms.web.app/","developerAddress":"Room 1003, 10/F, Tower 1, Lippo Centre, 89 Queensway, Admiralty, Hong Kong","privacyPolicy":"https://new-nqms.web.app/privacy.html","developerInternalID":"8252605626705856103","genre":"Productivity","genreId":"PRODUCTIVITY","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/aeYS-47MpJQi-14JMGYlAaZPa_09gWNMnuS-muIzjk1WY68e9BtgMvoUjQhHHlHgRNg","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/dpfZSIMeWYIpKxD0V6gtDmhmb_qwP13MpZOP4GBzwMtscesZdGhLaHchI5HdYVdn4Q","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/s3GJQHKVt8HYaKhWrrmjOjBPY_go5rhbA3X5wUf3DW7QobTen9xMZeZyHVypR5Swww","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/NFX8ViQCcXAp1kNex1mCs1xKQTktvMYeVxWFXYnGlQOpGgIsq1cKFYY5U_qKYYP-MA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1sOX9sGMF-UN5D6T5akAgzIkKufM2EkAD8toB3QiuxBnv1J7OzeloE0-tQxvnCRH4w","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/yWZwjVxaW2tm2pGGgCt3snuU2Bb7OH3td3Hsun2uyhjku0xU5U_mEyhel15zahKc4dvT","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2YBRZJf4efMsVv8gMC19l7IxqXls0SqOKPfyELZc45jpTKIOQ9xzMhC1G9QtpkbFfjZu","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/24IID4SuOMSYwhwoMDAQKVec19fpjQp627yGEB1PdMt7lXWb_tKrqbaB9mg9zLemhWQ"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Feb 25, 2011","updated":1622108938000,"version":"9.2.09.00","recentChanges":"Support Android 11<br>General fixes and stability improvements.","comments":["I've had this application on all phones that I've had in past few years never had a problem.

The free version allows for two routine sequences, plenty to get a feel for whether it could help you (and it may be all you need!). I gladly opted for the paid version and have \"on\" day, \"off\" day, and bedtime routines. I love the ability to pause (and the reminders to unpause!) and being able to change the order on the fly, if needed. I wholeheartedly recommend it.","3 stars because it is a fantastic app but getting someone to respond to a problem isn't happening. I am not receiving notifications while I am in the middle of a routine needing to move on to my next task. I set a time to clean for 30 minutes and 45 minutes later I'm still going because no notifications have come through. Only when I unlock my phone again does the app tell me to move on and then tells me how much time I went over with the task was on. I really wish someone would get back with me","Wow, Routinery got me on track for my goals in only a few days! It's so easy to use, I love how the timer counts down, before this app I was constantly running late or taking forever to do a quick task. when I needed to move a little faster looking at the timer does the trick. I am so much more productive now.","I love the concept behind this app and it has genuinely helped me build good new habits, like meditation and reading. I will therefore be purchasing the premium version. However, it could use some tweaks and polish. For example, having alarms that continuously ring until they're silenced, rather than single little beeps, would prevent me from going way over time.","Accommodates shift work! I get home at midnight most days, but the \"day\" isn't over until you go to sleep! Routinery gets that, and you can set your day end time. I've been really enjoying the overall cleanliness of the app, too. It's helping me take control of the time I have, and get the things I want to do, done!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.alt.goodmorning","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alt.goodmorning&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Plague Inc: Scenario Creator","description":"Enter the lab and develop your own custom scenarios for Plague Inc. with this powerful yet easy to use tool.

I'm a paid annual subscriber via Google Play Store for a couple of years, now, and still am. All of a sudden ads started appearing, making this app almost unusable. I thought that \"Restore Purchase\" would fix it, but it said \"No purchase to restore\". I've contacted Developer Support twice but I haven't yet heard back from them. If they help me \"restore\" my purchase I'll restore their 5-star rating.","This app covers pretty much everything your phone needs and more. The ads are very short, out of all the apps I've used this one is ultimately the very best out there, it's free , it's not ad intrusive, it covers so much with ad ons, it's perfect!!","I have been using this app for a few years and I love it; it stops unwanted background processes, cleans unwanted files andcached, etc. and just keeps my phone running smooth. Today I've made several attempts to open the app but it stays on the blue intro. screen. I rebooted my phone 2x, force stopped app, checked updates (there were none), used phones cleaning tool; all of which did nothing. Something is very wrong. I would usually give 5 stars but not until usable again.","8/21 - Can you please get rid of the redirect ads? I am most disturbed by ads that redirect to this app even after leaving your site. I love the cleaner (using on my 4th new phone) but really hate the new ads after using boost & battery boost. Before, there were ads but none that would redirect. It's too bad that the advertising is getting in the way of the cleaner. Surprised that such an easy app would clean & boost my phone so well.","Invasive notifications sent back to back literally. Couldn't even do what I was trying to do because I had to stop to get rid of the message that just stays there on the screen. Be careful what you allow in the permissions. If it continues I'm uninstalling it. Very annoying and interferes with important tasks."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"imoblife.toolbox.full","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=imoblife.toolbox.full&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Habit Tracker：Daily Planner Organizer,Goal tracker","description":"Habit Tracker can make the daily planner and goal tracker become productive organizer.That helps you build a routine of positive, good habit.

I like that you can get a shop reward on completion of a certain task without having to buy it. I also like the pomodoro feature. I wish we could edit the attribute section though. Edit: I was experimenting with the synthesis feature which is also unique to this app and it's very well done. You can choose to buy something from the store with another store item or many other items like xp, coins etc","I find this app highly effective. I first scoffed at the idea of the gamification of discipline to accomplish boring/tedious/menial/taxing/important tasks. Then I tried it. I absolutely love this app. The fact that I feel so convicted for not accomplishing my tasks makes this app amazing, because I refuse to allow to gratify myself with enjoyable activities like gaming or browsing youtube until I've earned enough coins to do so, through completing the more important tasks in my life. It takes a bit to set up your own little economy, but I think I've got it down pretty well. The widget for the home screen is good.","This app is amazing, what I was expecting was not all these features and it is almost perfect. I just wish I could add more attributes. Other than that everything is perfect, not too complex, takes a few minutes to learn but worth every penny.","A super clean app that's worth the small price. Although as of now, you are unable to customise the opacity and general theme of the widget when it's in light mode, which kinda sucks... (Fear not for you dark mode users though, since you can customise that)","I enjoy it, really holds you accountable because you want to complete tasks like a video game. I hope this continues to improve as it's a more recent app. Some more features like avatars, boss battles, other quality of life improvements, etc. will take this app to the very top in my opinion."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"net.sarasarasa.lifeup","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sarasarasa.lifeup&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"QR Code - Barcode Reader Free","description":"Qr Code Reader is completely free of cost and highly secure.

I love its many features. I like that it coordinates with TASKS which moves tasks automatically to the next day if not accomplished. The only reason I am not giving Business Calendar 5 Stars is that from time to time it will drop an appointment and that bothers me! I missed an appointment the other day because of it! It wiped out some birthdays last year. That really aggravated me! I don't know why this happens.","Not fully customisable as claimed unfortunately. You used to be able to set it that tapping any date in the widget would open up that month, now it opens the day and when I wrote to the developer they said that'll never change now. The double click feature is buggy, when you click on an adjacent date it still counts it as a double press. There's also no way to turn that off, either, to quote the developer 'this is the design' and that's that.","Excellent calandar app. I tried dozens of calendar apps before finding this one.. My husband and I both use the app and it links to our Google calendars. We have several calendars set up (his stuff, my stuff, joint stuff, birthdays, bank Holidays), plus task lists, reminders, etc. and it all works perfectly and syncs immediately. We paid to upgrade so there are no adverts and the premium features like dragging and dropping make it very easy to use. Wouldn't be without it.","As of summer 2021, still the best calendar app I've used. If you want to actually see what you have scheduled, in a proper month view, this is the app for you! None of this \"minimalist\" stuff that adds unnecessary tapping to see what's scheduled. Has calendar grouping to quickly show/hide events so you can find what you're looking for easily. Seriously, get the paid version. It's worth every penny!","I love the option of color coding events. Sharing calender is HARD. Doesn't always sync like it's supposed to. I really love this calendar but due to not being able to share and keep apts up to date I'm on the hunt again for a new calendar. If it was just for my use this would be perfect."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.appgenix.bizcal","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appgenix.bizcal&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"INKredible PRO","description":"INKredible PRO includes all in-app purchase features of INKredible (a $9 value) plus free future updates.\r\n\r\nIt’s amazing how pen and paper, two inventions dating back to thousands of years ago, have been almost irreplaceable.

It seems numbers in titles are sorted by digits instead of value, so notebooks display in order as Chapter 1, Chapter 10, Chapter 2, Chapter 3, etc. If this is changed to sort by value then I would have no problems. It is great for notes and handwriting otherwise, but the current organization method is a little annoying.","This app changed the way I take notes on my phone and tablet. I was so comfortable with the old toolbar that the new one felt clunky at first, but after a few days of using the app, I can see the advantages of the new toolbar in the current app and how it will facilitate new features in the future. One feature I would absolutely love is to be able to import a PDF as a template/custom paper for new notes. I would like to create my own variant of one of the Productivity paper types for a work diary. Maybe, as an incentive for others to upgrade to the Pro version, you could create an online gallery where Pro users can create and upload their own paper types and share them with other Pro users?","Love this app for note taking. I am very excited to use it with my digital planner. Love the pens! Love that I can import my planner template. Would love to be able to use the hyperlinks set up in the planners as well as do some image editing. Specifically the ability to take an image and adjust its transparency.","More saving bugs! I think that there are auto save bug? Sometimes it kick me out and everything I previously wrote are gone! Nice apps, the best one currently in Android. But the new design updates is currently suck, it's not faster and it requires more click to change tools/color etc. Love the old design more. Also, split screen doesn't work properly any more. [mabe favorite toolbars for each tools? Cus changing color is much more harder with new designs, pls fix!]","Still great app! I feel bad though. I can see some people aren't happy with the new updated tool bar. It may be a little buggy but it does have potential. You guys really do care about the app and the quality of it, I'm sure you guys will figure it out. If I may suggest, maybe on the next update add the ability to customize the quick tools? I don't use the text tool much and I don't toggle palm rejection mode off and on but I do toggle closeup mode on and off and insert page action often.

That's mind blowing for me. It helped perfectly to block out distractions.. I haven’t seen any ads yet. Lots of thanks. and thanks for beautifully adjusted notification reminders and screen time Notification. i Always wanted to monitor my screen time but used to foget to check. Now i can see it in Notification.","This app is powerful, but not so powerful that you can crash your device. However, this app needs to implement better safe guards when blocking the phone. I would suggest implementing separate blocking logic for the phone app such as 3 minutes of emergency calling with a 15 minute block, or adding a special button for calling 911. Another alternative would be defaulting to allowing the phone in whitelists unless specifically unchecked by the user. I would advise starting with say a 5 minute one time block so that you can ensure your profiles are working as intended before you commit to a long lockout, or else be prepared to boot your device into safe mode to disable anything that ends up having unintended consequences. Speaking of safe mode, realize that safe mode is intended to revert your phone to factory defaults so anyone sufficiently desperate can access any stock app. Finally, in extreme cases the user can perform a factory reset to lose all data for access to any app. I like that this app allows both whitelisting and blacklisting apps as different profiles require different configurations. I wish that it would have a category option to help with more complicated rules. You can find similar apps for a little cheaper and many that cost 10x as much per YEAR, so I think this app is fairly priced especially for its ease of use.","This app is literally life changing. I have worked with the developer to iron out some issues and also changed my phone to a Samsung Galaxy S20. Huawei phones had an issue that stopped me using the app to its full potential. Being an ex IT professional and severely addicted to my mobile phone I was desperate to find a solution to help me stay off my phone, yet I kept finding routes in to my addiction. I now, finally, feel calm, undistracted, free to get on and enjoy my life and be a productive member of society again. I think it is difficult to imagine for most people how soul destroying it can be to be addicted or suffer addiction of any kind unless you experience it yourself. I have felt like I have lost months and months of my life over the years to just sitting there scrolling, scrolling, scrolling my life away and not being in control. Believe me when I tell you that if you have the right phone, and this software you can regain the control in your life and turn your very smart phone into a tool rather than your master. Remember it isn't your fault. The apps on your phones are designed to turn you into an addict. This application can help you regain control yet still be able to use the key functions of your phone without them taking over your life. Download it, Pay for it. Whatever it costs believe me it is worth it. Many thanks to the developer Flaviu for being responsive to me and to his customers, simply amazing service and product, I couldn't ask for more.","If you have mobile/youtube addiction, go ahead and install this app, it will save you and your time(not an overstatement)! It has multiple lockouts too, thank you so much to the developers, great job, keep up the good work!😇","Works great. I use it to remind/force me to take breaks when I'm not paying attention because otherwise my phone use aggravates my RSI.

The pro version is worth the money to remove ads and upload large files, highly recommended","Works very well for the most part. Unfortunately I appear to have hit some edge case where an upload initially failed, so I tried again and instead of retrying the upload it thought the file had been uploaded and deleted from the cloud, so it decided to delete the copy on the device (which was the only copy of that file). It wasn't data I was willing to lose... Be very cautious of using 2-way sync in this app 😞","I tried gdrivesync. That one didn't recognize my sd card. this one does. On the free version of this app, you only get one folder pair to sync, meaning you have to put everything you want on your google drive and on your phone in one folder each location. You can still have subfolders on each side, and it will still mirror the subfolder structure, so you can add everything you want, but I love this app, so I paid for the ultimate version. You don't have to to get a use out of this app though.","Billions of time better than Google Drive and Google One apps.. Here we can choose exactly what type of files, what folder and where to save them. And you have access to the files in real time... Google One decides what to backup, what folders and you never have direct access to the files, so it's a gamble.. Here you can check exactly what was backed up. Paying for the premium was totally worth it. I leave my consideration to the developers. Thank you so much.","Let's me automatically upload my phone's photos to Google drive (from where they are synced to my computer's hard drive as back up). I prefer storing in Google drive rather than Google photos because of the desktop sync option, which means I'm no relying 100% on Google for access to my precious photographs."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.ttxapps.drivesync","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.drivesync&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"GetHabit: Motivation & Planner","description":"GetHabit is a personal helper which is perfect for setting goals, tracking your progress, motivating and challenging yourself to new heights! \r\n\r\nGetHabit can help you with planning your schedule to create healthy new habits.

They offer a week-long trial, but I was charged the full monthly amount 3 days after signing up for the trial. There is no customer service number to get a hold of, and even though it's a monthly subscription, there is no option to cancel or stop subscription in either my PayPal or Google play account. The website says 14-day 100% money back guarantee, but customer service is AWOL. There's also no \"account\" to manage from the app itself. No way to update subscription","So wish to pay more attention for the reviews earlier! Police should look at proper money stealing in this case. I've never seen so bad customer services! Even if you ask to cancel subscription, they are not doing it, but taking money from your account. App itself is messy, not very helpful.

Saw the ad in FB, answered some questions to determine my habits & I keyed in my email to see the plan. Received an email to download my plan & start a free trial, but it did not indicate how long the trial was going to be. Next thing I know, on the 4th day, I saw a deduction for the subscription. There was nothing on the app to manage my payment or cancel my subscription. Now I'm waiting for their email reply.","I wish I had read more reviews. This app sucks. Plus, they charged me 3 different amounts, which totaled almost $60!! I've emailed them twice and they refunded the first charge of $0.99, but never responded nor did anything with the $19.99 or $37.99 charges. This app MIGHT be worth $5.00. It is very basic and not very useful because I don't get notification reminders, so what's the point?!","After a mix up at the start with subscriptions (asked thus be rectified for all users to make it clearer) a great app for what I need.

It's SUPER glitchy. For example, I set a timer on a particular website so that I can only spend 7 minutes per hour on the site. I get the 5 minute warning, then a 59 second warning, but then the website only gets blocked half the time. When I click on the timer to \"see how much time I have left\" it's either blank or, somehow, back at something like 2 mins 55 seconds?","Bugs detected. I have purchased the pro version. And now, even after enabling all the permissions, every time I open the app, the red box appears saying I must re-enable the accessibility and disable battery optimization. Also, a suggestion: Instead of having to block the whole settings app, it would be great to block access to disabling permissions of stayfocused during the strict block or locked mode. I frequently need settings to check my systems. So, it would be appreciated.","Helpful app. I like that i can set the actual time that certain apps deactivate instead of setting a timer. I can set it to deactivate social media at bedtime so i don't keep scrolling, and for wake up time so i don't stay in bed scrolling and end up getting up late. The app is a bit cluttered and not very explanatory but once you figure it out its ok. The lock mode doesn't seem to work properly for me though. I set it to level 2 but can still edit my profiles without a password","Great for targeted time outs. Difficult to bypass, so it gets the job done. A ton of features I haven't explored simply because I'm getting what I need out of the well-designed app. Edit: App is so complicated now I have to figure out how to do a quick block every time I need it. Buried on menus now and a bloated UI. But have to admit it works and works well.","There is nothing that I do not like about this app. I am a premium user since around 2 years. I stopped using this app since the past year (due to laziness during lockdown) and my phone addiction was on peak. I was so frustrated with my life and this app came to my rescue, again. I love this app so much! Also, there are so so so many different modes of setting timers, strictness levels and what not. The blockers work perfectly without any glitches.

Very convenient to organize baby files!

I would normally buy the premium option except the prices are obnoxiously high. The app is that good to charge 50 bucks. Especially since most other apps with similar pricing are often abandoned by the developer because no one wants to pay for underwelming upgrade options for typically half the value of most phones after one year of use. Not something id consider investing in. Drop the full premium price to like 15 would sound more reasonable and drop the whole subscription idea","I tried this app for functionality because it was the closest to ES File Explorer since they took down the app. Tried it, became a paid subscriber in two days. Very convenient UI. I had an issue with file transfer to cloud but the developers corrected it quickly. I would highly recommend RS File : File Manager & Explorer to anyone looking for the convenience of a desktop folder manager.","UPDATE : i would have given it 5 stars but the issue gets more bitter when i wasn't able to login another google drive cloud it keeps saying 'auth failed' after given all 7 permissions to my account. please fix the issue. app is not stable, it always gets interrupted while transferring files from cloud to device in background, i've even turned off battery optimisation for this app but that didn't helped at all, this stability issue should be fixed, please fix this on the next update, regards.","I give 4 stars because it can not connect to yandex .

Then one day the ability to see my streak disappeared, without warning, and it looked like I had to buy Prime to get it back, so I did. I paid $20, which is a crazy price but I've been using this app for 9 months and I didn't want to start over with something else. I can now see my streak, but it was reset to zero! I can see all my history, but the app is choosing to ignore it. Not cool.","I've been using this app as a scorecard to keep track of my habits. I've enjoyed it and used it enough to pay for the life time option. It would have been a five star if the app provided some sort of graph to give an overall big picture for each of your habits listed.","Absolutely love this app! Just was wondering if we could have both the build and simply tracking habits jump to the bottom when checked? Right now only the build ones do. Thanks in advance!","Good app, but the recent update to enable emojis defaults to placing an emoji on new habits, or updating an existing habit. I can't find how to make a habit without emojis. I don't want emojis and this is quite annoying. How do I turn this off?","Over time this app has gone from good to excellent and the developer is continually improving it.

It is also really helpful for self-learning as this app also lets you annotate pdf files, and with the help of the tab option you can easily switch with the notebooks to the file. My only concern is that there is no option for the eraser to only erase a portion of what has been written using the pen, you have to really delete the whole last line you just wrote and redo it.","This is the best UI app for PDF note-taking so far. Unfortunately, there is no 'Save' button to automatically replace the current file to the same directory. Exporting the file takes some time.","I have tried more than 50 apps but this is one of the the finest app for teaching... there is no better app for edditing and recording videos of pdf's. The only problem I face in adding text and sometimes text around images. Otherwise it is too good ... still I am giving 5 stars. Thank You Flexcil team.","My favourite note taking apps so far. Pop up notes is very useful when I need to refer to multiple pdf or pages of a pdf. The ability to merge and rearrange pdf pages is great. The folder/subfolder system makes it very easy to store all my pdfs and notes conveniently. Lots of pens. Settings provide a greater degree of customisation compared to Samsung notes. All in all, money well spent. Thank you!","This is best & the LITERARY the only FREE app that can be used instead of Samsung notes . The app's so good because of its , book covers , templates & mainly ORGANIZATION. I've also seen some videos which they were saying the FUTURE-NOTETAKING App . I can't simply believe that actually it's a free app to use and you know I actually freaked out seeing the this app is available in Android devices cause you know all best apps are only made for Apple , MacBook , or iPad like goodnotes 5 ."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.flexcil.flexcilnote","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flexcil.flexcilnote&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"PDF Reader Pro","description":"『PDF Reader Pro』 is an all-in-one edit tool for PDF files. \r\nView, Edit, Scan, Annotate, Markup, Comment, Convert, Manage, Fill & Sign on your PDF pages with PDF Reader Pro for now!\r\nYou can easily read, edit, and manage PDF pages with PDF Reader Pro on your android devices anywhere & any time.\r\nThe official team of PDF Reader Pro now provides you with a free trial for the experience.

I initially thought I wouldn't like it due to it only allowing 2 file pants at a time, but it hasn't detracted that much from the useability. My preference would still be to have the ability for more panes, but it's not enough to take off any stars. You will do well using this as your go to file manager.","Excellent root file explorer however once in a while files or sub folders are simply not showing - an empty space is showing instead. A refresh may or may not resolve this. Please address.","Been using the paid version for a while now but after the last update it is requesting full access to storage which essentially means it can read or write storage without my consent.

Also, I selected rolling offset with an 3/4 ideal cast iron bender. Put in my height and roll but gave me ridiculous spacing between bends and doesn't tell you what degree.","The app works great, I was a bit hesitant to buy it at first, but it soon made me a believer. We all know that the deducts of older side winders or on any bender fades over time, this app has them all down and it has the travel measurements too!.. it also works if you have no signal.","My favorite tool in my tool box. This app is basically cheating. I've been able to make some incredible installs with this app. This app really becomes useful when you want to thread rigid straight and bend it to the right lengths \"mathematically\". If nothing else, I use it to reference bender specs like take up, radius and gain.","I'm an industrial electrician, I haven't had to make a segmented or consecutive bend before. I had a stick of 1\" RMC and need a 180° bend 26\" diameter at a height of 2'. I set up a greenlee 555 for the job and tested the bend on a stick of 3/4 IMC as a test \"Didn't have many 1\" sticks\". Needless to say I forgot to switch to 3/4 for the greenlee so my deduct was 2\" off. But the diameter was great.","This is a fantastic app. Years ago I made a chart for all the benders I've used on the job which included info about the start of bend, the centerline radius, the deductions and the minimum distance from the end of conduit to the shoe. It also had the formula for the developed length of a bend. I don't have to use that chart anymore.

You will spend to maybe 5 to 10 minutes for the app to load to a different page or to start the app. When you want to delete a task, well you'll have to wait another 5 or 10 minutes. Not only that but the app is full of bugs I would go in more detail but I'm out of words..","Used to love this app until the last update. Notification bar will no longer clear, even after you've clicked the \"done\" button. It doesn't matter how many times I go into settings to switch off the uncompleted tasks counter, it still appears and the settings go back to what they were moments before without saving. This app has basically become useless overnight, which sucks because I used it all the time previously. Back to the app store to look for an alternative, I guess.","The app as a whole accomplishes exactly what it says it does. My biggest grievance with the app is that it doesn't seperate today's plans from other days. It takes a second to figure out what you're looking at when it shouldn't. Another problem is that when you create a recurring task, you cannot adjust the reminder time from day to day, meaning people who work part time or have irregular schedules have to make an individual reminder for each time (which is impossible to do on the free version)","Absolutely love this app! Perfect and simple interface for planning my days for the week. I paid for the premium but unfortunately I switched to iphone and was very disappointed you don't have it for iOS. Please please please make an iOS version!!! This app is amazing. I'll gladly pay for premium again and I know others will love the app on iphone. There aren't any half as good as this one. Keep up the awesome work <3","I love this app so much. It helps me a lot. I downloaded it so I can see if it will work for me before school and I know that it will help. I also love the way there is a notification at the top of the screen so it can remind me how many things I can do. There was another app similar to this but I love this app more because the other app was a bit too complicated so I deleted the other app. But it really helps me a lot more than a diary we use at school.

I paid for the premium, but found the toggle menu to be a hassle. Why can't we choose our default landing page? Why must timeline be our default? Why can't we access our projects with one click? Why isn't there a dedicated page for projects? Why can we only access it from the timeline? Why can't we resize the font? There's just so much in lack of customizability that the app unfortunately feels clunky to use compared to other apps.","Haven't really tried the app yet, but I've inspected it, it's features, took a good idea about it, and damn is it good for monitoring yourself. 4/5 stars because I don't want to 5/5 a product I didn't really use yet on a daily basis. Once I do so, if I didn't get into experience-breaking issues, I'll 5 star it. Btw... NO ADS!!! 😍🤩😃","there is no home screen widget available and hence its very difficult to operate as every hour you will have to go into the app to start a project which is forgetable for a beginner and would have been much convenient if there was an widget with timer for homescreen where you can quickly start and stop the projects with the click of a button","It's very good app but the thing you need to know is your belief in yourself when you set a timer for some work and if it just crosses the limit so you become stressed about ( as a student) your work and again you selfdoubt yourself so please it's on the basis of my personal experience that you should use it only when you think you are going out of track slowly thanks"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.boostedproductivity.app","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.boostedproductivity.app&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Mobile Data Collection - Scan-IT to Office","description":"Scan-IT to Office is a smart app for mobile data acquisition and barcode scanning in real-time.

I really liked it. I had to uninstall because of storage space priorities. Now that I've got more available space in my phone, I've reinstalled. Unfortunately, it keeps crashing. I open it, and it instantly closes. Then I have to open it again. And if I leave it to go to Home and another app, then go to pull it up again, it crashes. I've done all the basic trouble shooting. Didn't help. Incredibly disappointed.","widgets entirely broken. I paid for this thing and none of the widgets work anymore. Zero reason why they'd have failed. Hasn't seen an update in forever. sad, because it's otherwise gorgeous and I'd definitely recommend it.","Disliked the app so much that I got rid of it after 1.5 hours. Not really free, not like it claimed to be. Here's a real warning though: once you sign up, it's hard to get out. There was nothing on the app to let me delete my account, I can't get to it on the web, so I wrote to them THREE AND A HALF MONTHS AGO and just got a response today. After several nonsensical messages, I still can't get the account closed. This company just scoops up other apps and collects them for profit. I'd stay away from all of their apps.","Used it for two years but now that I changed phones, I somehow can't easily migrate all the data over.

However there are 2 features missing in my opinion. 1. To copy user name & password from the Password Safe App and paste onto another view (page or app) one currently has to switch between both views twice. Ideally the user should be able to copy and paste both user name & password at once. 2. The copied information from the Password Safe App should be automatically deleted/removed from the clipboard after certain amount of time. Keep up the great work. 😊","I find the app very easy to use and secure. It has no connection to the Internet, so makes it secure. I am lost without it. I have tried quite a few password apps but none of them offer the functionality as this PasswordSafe. But it would be nice to have an option of backup up the data somewhere other than the mobile, in case the mobile is lost or broken.","Coming back over 2 years later simply to say this app is fantastic. I recommend it to everyone I know that hates remembering passwords.. I couldn't even tell you when I downloaded it but I know it's been longer than 2 years since I've had this app never had one problem. Had multiple phones and the backup worked seamlessly when I restored the database. The Auto backup feature to my SD card saved me once when a phone screen shattered so bad that I wasn't able to salvage the phone.","This is a simple yet very reliable app for storing passwords. Recently I swapped to a new phone and there is a straightforward way to make a backup file to use to transfer information to the new phone.","Very secure and easy to use password storage. Easy to navigate, search and enter fields. Five stars for functionality.

The bug is that when you create a custom widget with just time on it, after a while, time doesn't start to update. For example, time is 12.45 here right now but my time on the widget is 11.05, it's way off.","It's a good app but I'm having some kind of issue. One of my widgets are meant to update every 1 second, as it was set. Yet it updates every 20 to 30 seconds and messes up elements which are supposed to go transparent when it reaches a certain amount of seconds. Is this a problem with my device or is the refresh interval not doing what it says? I'm on an Android 9; Sony model.","A little glitchy, but it's not bad.

Available on multiple platforms including windows 10, Apple OS, Android for smartphones.

It has great security, cloud backup & family password sharing capability!","Using Firefox nightly I was able to get autofill working again! Four stars because app performance when searching is bad.

I don't know what people are complaining about! The suggested routines make perfect sense. They also guide you in creating your own routines & tasks. The UI is straightforward. One of the easiest. They complained how expensive this app is - that's rubbish! Yes, there are cheaper ones. But MOST other GTD/Scheduling Apps/planners etc are, in fact, CONSIDERABLY more expensive. Love it.","I'd like an option to decrease the amount of notifications. I had to disable them because they were really annoying. I don't need five notifications for one task. I'd also like to be able to look ahead to future weeks and an to add tasks that occur less often than weekly. Like bi-weekly, monthly, and so on. Other than those complaints, this app has definitely helped me stay on task and more focused. Hell, I think it's changed my entire day-to-day life so far!","good app, love the fact that you can add a photo to each task. I'm still at trial period and I think that subscription plans are way too expensive. Usually apps with simiar funcionality cost half of what they are asking. UPDATE: routine that I was creating didnt save, and previous modifications of it also disappeared (some error appeared). Quite dissapointing for an app that costs 45£(!) a year or 7£(!) a month...","this app has a terrible interface and is absolutely unusable. the idea of trying to force tasks into a schedule and also forcing the user to choose an icon or image for each task is absolutely nonsense and people should instead look to goals and steps in reaching the goals so dependencies and requisites and so on would have been much more useful.","Beautiful but too simple for me.

So I've updated to a 2 star until future updates have it actually work again. CAD pockets works better now","This app can't open any drawing. Indeed this app does not see any CAD drawings let alone open it. Tried selecting the file and choose \"open with\". Didn't still work. Should have given less than one star if that was possible.
