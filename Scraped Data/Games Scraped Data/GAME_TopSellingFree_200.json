Levels are repetitive and it's not exciting at all. There are other issues such as ads. We already know about the ads so there is no point explaining. Once you reach the final multiplier you get money super quickly and you buy a bunch of arrows and it's kinda impossible to loose. I had to make my own little challenge to reach 420 for arrows and 699 (haha funny numbers) for the other one (I forgot the name).","3 stars because i respect the time developers put into this game. But, this game really is aimless, dull, and very ad heavy. Collecting arrows to earn coins that can only be spent on more arrows and coin reward boosters, then bombard players with ads: not my cup of tea. The concept has the potential to be great with mini side games, challenges, a cool store, and maybe even some sort of storyline. Good luck.","Way too easy, even ignoring ads, it's garbage. I decided to continue to play after the level 10 completion (literally the game stops getting harder after level 10) so I found a glitch, if you use an auto clicker while upgrading, you can still upgrade during and after a level, and if you get through the level by luck, you don't pay for the upgrades anymore, so I got to level 150k and 225k on the 2 upgrades, and get 1b per level, and every 2 levels, I encounter an overflow, and go back to 0 coins.","This game has alot of ads and it has a strait point to it. They have levels that you can unlock a new arrow, when you get to a certain level you can get new arrows,, but it never works. The upgraded cap at 12500,(it doesn't increase) and now when I play it takes me 30 minutes to get rid of all my money (I make 50 mil per run which is stupid). I beat the game in less than one game and it never changed. I just thought it was funny how the developers of this game just didn't care that it was good.","Absolutely unplayable without adblock. Ignoring the ads however, the game itself is still awful. Its dull, repetitive, and lacking any actual entertainment. Leveling up is mindless, you eventually get to a point, even before level 50, where coins are meaningless, as you have so many. You can't even tap and hold to upgrade, you need to tap over and over. Additional skins can only be \"bought\" through ads, further invalidating coins. This is by far one of the worst games I have ever played."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.nanotribe.games.arrowfest","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nanotribe.games.arrowfest&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Castle Raid!","description":"Cut the grass to control your army and battle the enemies to take their castle!","descriptionHTML":"Cut the grass to control your army and battle the enemies to take their castle!","summary":"Clash And Conquest!","installs":"1,000,000+","minInstalls":1000000,"maxInstalls":2270398,"score":3.591524,"scoreText":"3.6","ratings":4499,"reviews":1639,"histogram":{"1":1188,"2":215,"3":219,"4":498,"5":2377},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$3.49 per item","size":"77M","androidVersion":"7.0","androidVersionText":"7.0 and up","developer":"VOODOO","developerId":"VOODOO","developerEmail":"info@raketspel.se","developerAddress":"4 rue Jules Lefebvre, 75009 Paris","privacyPolicy":"https://www.voodoo.io/privacy","developerInternalID":"8306041507631589049","genre":"Arcade","genreId":"GAME_ARCADE","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/jzp7ddyQc9QrSaW4QFJLVuDT7kSZeq155BkHV-zwZ4mXpm1MTJJNjnBCWnBMiYTM-w","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AzYEz47jAnnH9g6P5SP7ZgZTZgbS2XIJ_ICyq6-osRgN578PNbriNtbV5XRw22ycNDt0","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7Gr7TAdo47XG52KIGNFCH6xL_yCu8uKmo98DIv7DCOmRsdEKyAHaMuI9Hr74wbrWCg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/MPcdGBeoZNKe16JKBCFuLHAJ5WXDadsPlV0Bxy6pRwhatBZIznvap4Wx-yG9Zy-p_Q","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1Ird_heyW8NEo3LwJtmTdSZeED4UIe8ZT8FhVppKi8BZdidfPDEorGthRwEODf4ekiGT","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3pp5EyNkR1PuAnGO1-SGrwroMm6pRHeobVJrihW-b9uRv20j8INBdG0UgzZL8j8PxZk","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AYgzqH8z6ROCbrw-RtW3Oy2199HNgoG6SvoA83D9K6VN4PQTNdr792jA34wTsyw_3qE","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AloVk1tARsZH0bAwHa8jJyQKwcXWlTFE2HmEYzji9ZKvuMkPM7NaFrYGm6Ow6HREltE","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/hQHdyBgfxwTP5JQOTKaMq1165NT1gLpThazSYiNwULyPfNX9v45h93IPJa2eXXAjI6UI","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/bSRCZTfp30mIOPBbvgEYX-RnlL18jVMd8AAQtDCo9u3cymGabMEJ53fYqCpOk2KdIVU","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/e_dF7WShKTT0G1GKvEopJ3ixN3xtKBWIU8zHyVpnbnEYzLhLYkCG5ERgdTk20k-R_Sk","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9fmv6qU2jOuH9J5Z4srMb_zC414MKEICGA8xXaR2sICLVSXmqzc3VxTMUuZuw0c_YXM","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/_mkFXnjhS4q5TeqWATDvY-FvPjqNCXcAo2w5hrY4D-DEEQtDpCgS2Cta_xAxk7f5Eg4","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QkwFp_ZoPfux1ovbbKksz3Ki3Y_efRWnPakpCJEXJ-CKkDfouZsRZWkZ_RalQFiq-f8"],"video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/El5YZJiJl30?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","videoImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AzYEz47jAnnH9g6P5SP7ZgZTZgbS2XIJ_ICyq6-osRgN578PNbriNtbV5XRw22ycNDt0","contentRating":"Everyone 10+","contentRatingDescription":"Fantasy Violence, Mild Blood","adSupported":true,"released":"Feb 16, 2021","updated":1628192032000,"version":"1.8.8","recentChanges":"Compete with other players and reach the top of the leaderboard.<br>Added more levels and squashed a few bugs","comments":["Like all games from voodoo, it could be a lot of fun if you didn't have to navigate twice as much time watching ads as playing the game. Can't trust to remove ads because you pay the money and they don't remove ads. Very unfortunate that you guys can't do better. I get that you have to do ads, but it's ridiculous how many you have and how long they are.","Piece of advice. Turn off data for this app in settings and you'll be spared ads every 10seconds. Don't worry about the scoreboard too, this game is by voodoo kings of peeing in players mouths with fake multiplayer, so it obviously still works without data. Other than that the game is a satisfying little time killer. There are maybe only 20 level designs that are shuffled and progression stops after a while but its still fun enough to return to","Not a bad game, and actually is the game shown in the ads. Problem is that most of the ads generated out of the game appear to have no exits and require killing the app altogether (then re-playing the previous level) and hoping that the next ad will actually let you out. Since this renders the game unplayable, I'm uninstalling and rating 2 stars (sadly these days having the game match the ad is worth a bonus star in a review).","Absolutely horrible experience. The game itself is actually really fun but the amount of ads is stupid not only can you not skip any of them so they take 30 seconds at the least. They happen every time you finish a level or when you use a powerup during a level. In the forth level the game tells you to use one. Which causes an add 30 seconds later your guys defeat the frozen enemies and win. Which takes about 5 seconds only to get another 30 second add. Dont bother installing. Waste of time.","If you're gunna have fake 5 star reviews, at least make them believable. \"Great game. No ads\" What, you got absolutely no ads? You can clearly tell the real reviews from the fake ones. All the people that left a genuine review mention the ads one way or another but to say there's none at all is ludicrous."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.karimcastagnini.castlestorm","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.karimcastagnini.castlestorm&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Fidget Toys Trading: Pop It Games & Fidget Trade","description":"Join Fidget Toys Trading 3D — the most popular relaxing game filled with lots of fidget trading and trendy fidget toys.\r\n\r\nTired of boring antistress games with no gameplay but still want to relax?

I love how its only trading without 10,000 minigames inbetween. This is the game I have been looking for.

I recommend downloading it soon as you see this review and no people didn't pay me to say this like on all the others it's relaxing but the only part I don't really like is the playing with the fidgets part unless it's with a dimple but I don't usually use that I trade and the person your trading likes the first three fidgets in the controll's section and they will overpay (just a small hint...) But I rate this a solid!! Good work!! ;')","I really loved this game. It's fun and you can scan people, like in real fidget trading, but once you get to the part where you've already upgraded everything, and bought everything, it gets boring. That's why I gave it a 3 star review.","I really do like this app, its my fav game so far, but I would like it if you make it so that you can swipe your finger to pop the pop-it pops, add some more fidgets.

In a match an opponent was eliminating me in 3 sec with a lazer weapon. 2) could you make hiting certain areas on a robot deal more damage, for example, hitting the drivers cabin and back armor of the robot will deal more damage than aiming for the front armor. This will add more strategy. Other than that, it's a great game and I highly recommend it!","Game is good overall. Just encountering problems on two fronts; Firstly, the teammates that we are assigned automatically are mostly not exactly at our level or the level of our opponents and it is very problematic for us. Secondly, I know you guys have to earn money somehow. But it shouldnt be as hard to earn credits as it is. It is ver very very hard to get even a decent amount of credits no matter how much I play. So please please please atleast fix this problem if not both. Thanks a lot!","THIS GAME IS SO AWESOME!!!!! I now have the panther and it is one tough nugget! I absolutely love everything about this game. My strategy is to first use the Paragon at a battle and when I die, I spawn with the Panther and I always win with that strategy. Congratulations to the developer. I'm already becoming a pro at this game! Again congrats for the development of this amazing game. The graphics and game play is so smooth. Along with the awesome mechanics of this game.I love it!. Cool BTW","Hands down one of the best, if not, the best mecha game out there for mobile. Great control, amazing graphic, and surprisingly smooth performance even on a potato device. Just few suggestions to make this game even better: 1. Please increase the credit reward after each match, so we can progress much better. 2. Please add full-controller support. With this kind of graphic, it's a shame to not being able to play with controller. Please consider my suggestion, because I really love this game.","I like the game and all. The Mechs are cool. You can upgrade right away. I mean I started playing today and I have 2 Mechs and 5 or so guns. But you can't join battles in play. And message friends. You gotta wait till division 9. And sometime the game glitches.Well at least for me. I waited 10 minutes and it said it couldn't find any players. But other then that the game is cool. I have said everything needed."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.plarium.mechlegion","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plarium.mechlegion&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"My Talking Angela 2","description":"From Outfit7, the creators of popular virtual pet games such as My Talking Tom 2 and My Talking Tom Friends, comes the sequel to My Talking Angela!\r\n\r\nMy Talking Angela 2 takes Angela’s game to the next level!

But I have to agree with one of the reviews. Diamonds are not an easy currency to obtain. Usually in these types games along with the past Talking Angela game. Diamonds were more of a luxury currency for more expensive items that you might want to save up for. However in Talking Angela 2 alot of the upgrades and items cost diamonds to purchase. Makes the game more of a let down rather than something fun. Due to that I've had to stay with the limited free items.","This game is amazing! I love the graphics and the new things that you can do with Angela. However the fact that you need 20 diamonds just to get one thing to change you furniture is a bit of a scam. Diamonds don't come THAT easily and I believe they should be for coins. Another thing is there are not many games to choose from and in my opinion they are fairly boring and don't give much coins, also you can only rent some things. Otherwise this game is great and I would have given it five stars.","Honestly, I think this is a nice app! I am rating it 5 stars even though there is something that bothers me and I think it bothers a lot of people aswell. The ads are a bit too much, and sometimes they are always the same thing. It would be nice if there weren't that many ads, but sofar this game is great.","This game is amazing!!!!!Talking Angela 2 has all you can ever dream of like brushing, bathing, teeth care, sleep, eat and even dressing and makeup that you don't have to pay for, all free. Although, you can do anything on this app, it keeps coming up with adds. Please fix. So I am giving this app 5 stars because now this problem is fixed.😊😀","Oooooh! I love this game so much! :) and especially the outfits and hairs! Theres alot of hairs and outfuts that are really cute and pretty!

The controls are good, the combat flow is on fleek, and the story is pretty good! My only problem is how fast the game is. I mean sure, it's a phone game, phone games are meant to be simplistic games you play on your toilet, but even Angry Birds (which is a pretty simple game) is longer than this! I beat this in 2 days! And if I want more game, I gotta pay for it! Besides how short it is, this game is fun as hell. Five stars, 100% pog.","This game is just like my old days at Y8. It feels like I'm on a speedrun while playing this game coz I finished it under 30 minutes with 3 stars in each level, I'll keep on supporting this game. This is easy on regular mode however I don't want to spend any money purchasing the premium, so please add harder levels on the next update. Every game deserves a 5 star rating and a positive review so the developers can push forward and make the game better than it was before. Good job Developers.","The only thing that went up is the graphics quality in which I still dont like the style. You cannot walk, or slow the perception of time when you want to like in the original game. I downloaded this game for a remake of a game I used to play all the time and got something completely different. Really the change in mechanics and controls was the biggest part for me. Either add a few more buttons or call it something else. Overall it's not terrible but I'm not a fan","Great game and I totally appreciate the whole mobile re-design from the original, however, I really didn't like the control scheme... the \"drag and release\" input method simply kills the whole rythme of the game, i don't understand why the game doesn't have a simple virtual joystick on the left to control direction, and an A/B buttons on the right to Jump/Slide, and the shooting can remain the same (tap anywhere in the screen to shoot toward that direction). This was the only reason stopping me from buying the premium cause the current control really made the game very uncomfortable to play, i hope you consider this, cheers!","To say I'm a fan of this would be an understatement, this game is sooo good on phones. It's such a fun game, it translates to mobile very well. Not only that, but the fact that this is a brand new experience instead of just a port really livens the experience. This is a must-get if you're a fan of the 2019 My Friend Pedro and/or it's flash game origins."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.devolverdigital.myfriendpedro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devolverdigital.myfriendpedro&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Count Masters: Crowd Clash & Stickman Running Game","description":"Choose the best gate, pass through it, and bring stickman warriors together to clash with the opposing crowd.

In this version, we’ve added:<br>- General game improvements;<br>- Game balance update;<br>- Minor bug fixes for better user experience.","comments":["You know when you are spending more time, MUCH MORE TIME, watching ads than playing the game, it's pretty bad. Each round lasts at best 15 seconds, each add (some skiable, but have to hit ff or the x multiple times) last for up to 30 or more seconds, all you have a recipe for an app to watch ads rather than play a game. Horrible model that seems to be a trend. I miss the good old days of just playing a have without being force fed ads constantly. Developers need to get a life.","The game has potential and it's entertaining but the game is so bugged that it keeps me from even wanting to play. First off the performance is complete garbage. I can't complete a single level with a lot of guys at the end because the fps drops so much that it doesn't even register my movement and before I know it half my group of blue dudes fell off a ledge. Game is also repetitive and they're overkill on ads. Can't even unlock skins without watching ads which is bs. Don't waste the storage.","I like this game. Sure, it's fun, entertaining and yeah. But today I was playing and I opened a chest to try and get the best prize. Instead I got +25 💎, so I clicked on another chest to watch an ad for it. After the ad, things glitched out and It gave me a blank black screen and I couldn't play it again...Maybe I'd rate it 5 stars if it didn't glitch like this.","Totally pointless. You beat very easy levels. Win gems to build on an island. Building is complete very quickly. You're then winning gems, very easily for no reason at all. And that's before I start on the ads which are longer than game play. Woeful app.","Great idea and if it wasn't for that I got repetitive black screens already after track 5 or so, then I would give it 4 stars. Fix the bugs. The ridiculous building of an island on the side and recruiting an army, doesn't make any sense. For us who enjoys fast thinking games, the math part is enough.

My network has been working fine recently but weirdly whenever i try to go on it wont let me on. I'm talking like, doesn't even let me log on stuff. It just pops up with my network being bad and its the same with my chromebook. The real issue is that i have robux on that account and i really desperately want to get back on to roblox so i will be able to use it. I've tried about everything! Please someone tell me whats going on! I'm really worried!","Very good it's amazing. I recommend to play. Awesome. Not all games need robux. So we can play and we get free dress and accessories every week or month. Also we can never get bored. Cause it has so many games. I'm giving 4 stars because it is not allowing me to enter roblox and I hate it when it happens 😤 😡 but still if I give feedback it allows me. Also it takes a lot of time to download.","It was EPIC!!! I love it. Sometimes it glitched and says same account launched from a different account when I try to rejoin the game if I disconnected. It would be better if they added some new free items for people who don't have robux though. I don't like how the censor words that aren't even offensive to people eg. Secret.","The app is great to be honest,I have been playing for a year or two now and it got me hooked.The in-game currency is robux which'll need to be paid by real money but it's no problem for me since I'm capable of buying my own but the damn glitches and lags on the game made me hesitate to give this a five star,the screen sometimes stay on first pov and I know it's not because of my device 'cause it's new and high quality,the disconnecting of internet is also a problem,I have pretty good internet :(","To be honest, this game is great and I love it. But it definetly needs refunding and returning items back from ur recently purchased avatar items with robux. So people will or can be able to return something they have bought with robux, but end up not liking it instead of deleting the item permanently, they should be able to return it and get back their robux."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.roblox.client","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.roblox.client&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Heroes Inc!","description":"Craft the greatest Heroes in history and save the world!

AMAZING. Sure, it does have lots of ads but it keeps me busy 24/7. I found this game when I got an ad while I was playing Design Home. This is my favorite game on my phone and I love it so much. For people who are looking for a new game to keep you busy, I recommend Heroes Inc.","As is typical with these thrown together ad pushers, there's a clever idea here with minimal effort. If you could actually combine every element into a new hero or if the gameplay itself was any good this game could be super fun. Also, the fact that there are ads at the beginning, middle, and end of the really short level is just insulting.","It seems like it could have been a fun concept, but it's impossible to tell, thanks to the ridiculous number of ads. Six unskippable ads in stage 3 alone, the combined lengths of which lasted 4 times longer than the stage itself. I understand needing compensation, but perhaps try a little less aggression with it next time, because I'm spending more time out of the game than in it, and according to the other reviews, it's the only reason everyone deletes the app.","Amazing game. Easy controls. I like how vague the heros are. You're able to use your imagination from all the stuff you've played and watched and It can easily be them. Add heroes from my heroe academia like deku or all might. That'd be awesome. There's a bug were the Atlantis base, you can't buy it. Fix this pleaseeee. Keep up the great work!","The idea is good, and I do think the concept idea is good. However, after completing the third level, where you run through the city with one of your two previously created hero's, you are supposed to go into your collection and I guess upgrade a hero. But you can't. You only have one \"upgrade card\" for each of your two hero's and, it doesn't really show you what to do on this page. There's an add directly after the third level, and it just crashes the game. Fixing these will improve the game..."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.blueflamingo.herolab","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blueflamingo.herolab&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Evony: The King's Return","description":"\"Build your cities.

The only concern with endless upgrade is the exponential grind, ever increasing debt and constant marketing barrages for the coin in your pocket. Months later, still enjoying the game without spending a fortune.","I did have this as 5 star because the game is brilliant, well thought out but the game developers don't do anything about the massive amount of alt accounts. I know of one player that has 5 alts and another that shares the account. They are in a position of power due to this and bully the rest of the server. I want to continue playing as I have got to keep 33 and pay to play but can't compete with the many alt accounts. The developers need to block these blatant rule breakers.","Very addictive. Lots of ppl to befriend, build and grow in the game with.... I would like to see and improvement on the translation tool.... It's a really bad awful, and hard to understand. It doesn't translate adequately. And most of the translation are totally wrong.... I would like to see the availability for creating chat rooms that are more private then the world chat, like whispering but with the availability to add multiplayers a chatrooms regardless of alliances but still privately..","racism, harassment, and death threats, oh boy. Sure this game starts out with some nifty puzzles, but soon you'll find that the game is really about building your own little kingdom and to fight other keeps. Fun, sure. But this game costs real cashola (thousands) to become competitive and for that amount of cash you might think it will come with great customer service. Ha Ha Nope. You will send in service tickets and requests not only about the many many many new and varied glitches and outages the game contains (prepare to see that red flashy wifi symbol in your dreams) but there is no policing on the \"world chat\" Players can write paragraphs of racist, sexist and all around terrible text. This is the first game I've played where the creators don't give a flying flip about any of this. ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS ANYTHING THAT TAKES AWAY THEIR MONEY such as people buying resources off other players instead of from them. Anyhow, If you report players for racism, death threats, etc. and send numerous screen shots and proof, that player may... eventually... be banned for 24 hours from posting. What happens after 24 hours? they are back to doing the same old thing. Developers and customer service don't care. at all. And there is no escaping these same people day in and day out. Your keep lives on a specific \"server\" and there you stay. After a few days you can't move without starting over completely. So if this kind of torture is your thing, then hey have at it. They've developed a game that plays on your desire to complete tasks, and there are plenty of them. Enough to get you good and addicted. The other thing you need to know, is that you need to keep playing forever or you'll lose everything you've built. You can purchase 7 days of protection but its incredibly expensive, and that's the longest you can get. There is no taking a break and coming back. Once you start you have to keep going... forever. Welcome to hell, folks.","Total bait and switch. Takes way too long to upgrade your keep, only to get a handful of puzzles at a time. The whole element of building a kingdom and fighting others is tired and clunky, and the other players are rude and play dirty. Moreover, the ads for the game lead the viewer to believe the game is more about puzzle solving. Give us that game without all of the other nonsense."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.topgamesinc.evony","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.topgamesinc.evony&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Race Master 3D - Car Racing","description":"🏎️  Race Master 3D – Fast, furious and super-fun racing  \r\n\r\nKeep your finger to the floor and be ready for absolutely anything in this ridiculously entertaining mobile racing game where you really never know what’s around the next corner.

Half way thru a stage you are hit with an ad and when you get done with a stage ANOTHER ad. Like most of the other games these days the developers care nothing about the amount of game play you get. Rather the ONLY thing they are interested in is money. My advise is disconnect from the internet when playing this game and start blowing stuff up.","The game is fun but it is a little buggy. The daily reward doesn't work, every time you watch an ad to get the extra keys or reward you'll get stuck on the ad and you don't get rewarded and have to close the app and do it all over again, you don't get a lot of levels cuz once you finish the first stage or at least the first map of South America it doesn't let you go anywhere else. The game has great potential also you don't get enough time to use all the weapons you want to use or pick them.","One of the worst games I've ever played. You just can't play this game cos it won't let you. I was interrupted 6 times during one round of playing by ads. It drives you insane trying to play and it stops you right in the middle of the game. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. Also, the physics is just not there.","This game has alot of potential but once you make it to the first bonus round the game freezes as soon as you get 50.4% of the round finished. This happens everytime it has even froze my phone to the point of having to remove my battery to restart my phone. I hope they fix this issue because it is a decent game. Alot of the adds tend to freeze the game as well.","I really enjoy this game. Yes there were too many ads. However there is a cheap in app purchase to remove ads. If i enjoy the game then I dont mind paying to support the developers. To everyone else deal with the ads or pay a little, quit being so cheap it takes the developer time and energy to make a fun game. I only rated 4 stars because the other levels wont unlock. I am assuming they will be updates in the future. I cant wait for the other levels. Keep up the good work."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.feelnside.explodeme","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.feelnside.explodeme&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"PAW Patrol Rescue World","description":"Explore Adventure Bay like never before in PAW Patrol™ Rescue World!  \r\nSAFE & EASY fun game play for kids from their favorite show!

Also the game is too easy. It should be instead of you win as a hobo you should only win as poor, decent, rich and millionaire. I hate the fact we have to watch an ad to upgrade your rooms instead of just using money like you do to purchase the rooms. I play this game often but I wouldn't give it five stars.","I like this game very much but before I install this game I read some of the reviews and they all have problems in adds but actually you could just turn off your data or wifi and you could play it now without adds!! Because it was an offline game so I'm not surprised that you have problems in adds cause your data or wifi is on. But there's still some problems first it's really hard to control is it just my tablet or what?!!? It's really annoying that makes me lose!!!

I haven't played among us since march 2021, this was a very fun game until the chat got ruined, once I saw that update I stopped playing. I just came back to the game hoping that the chat was fixed and it's back to normal. But it wasn't. among us takes up quite a large amount of MBs on my phone, I just uninstalled among us. So until this gets fixed, among us will stay uninstalled for me. If you are reading this review, I HIGHLY recommend NOT installing Among Us.","This game is fun. For the most part anyways. There are problems. Like for example. How sometimes it is impossible to win a imposter game beacuse of the number of tasks. Or people that are afk making it so you cannot leave the voting screen. That one is very bad. Needs to be fixed. But with a little luck and a pray to the amoungs gods. You could be having fun for hours playing with a group of people. Also just to say this game should not be played by young childeren. I will leave it at that","Great game. I love to pretend to be part of the crew while I sabotage the mission in an attempt to destroy the ship. I wring my hands at the chance to kill an innocent crew member as they try to correct my subversion. The fact that I seamlessly blend in with everyone else only adds to the confusion as I shape-shift from crew member to imposter. So far I've only been kicked out of 109 games.","yes, sometimes games can seem the same all the time, but it's such a fun game. I hope innersloth will hear me & many others because i want the friends system so bad, and also the history of the games if you did not manage to add someone during the match, I met some cool people but I will never have fun with them again and it breaks my heart (but sometimes I still find their room by accident) I really want a response from the developers if they are going to add something like this.","I loved the original Among Us. It was a great game that I would've reccomended, but because people abused the free chat and customizable name, an update came that ruined the game and wasn't responded too very well. The chat was replaced with certain phrases that makes actually explaining something impossible. You permission from a parent to access the old free chat, and to verify you're a parent you have to pay money.

I have been playing it for years. And i like the fact that even thought there are ads, if you dont watch a video to continue, etc. Its just an ad and no video. Way better that ad videos. So you can easily x out without waiting for the ad to end since its just a picture ad. Great game. I would recommend it. Play it now if you're not sure its good or not. Its very fun besides the ads. Play it now!!!","This game literally sucks!!!First when I downloaded it, was fine but then, in the middle of my game it would glitch and my tiles would be at the bottom and I will loose. I would NOT recommend you this game. This needs to be repaired. And it has so many ads,like evertime you loose, the ad will pop out. Please fix this problem and I will change my ratings.","At first this app was very enjoyable untill it started getting glitchy and lagging when I'm playing. Too many ads as well.

As always, app performance was improved to bring you more surprises and fun!<br>Wishing you huge luck!","comments":["It was very easy to win jackpots even if I didn't have the $cash to buy coin packages. Very smooth and I didn't notice any bugs. I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't win a $100 gift card, etc. I spent a fair amount of time playing this game hoping that I could win something tangible. It probably would be fun for people who don't expect or wat to win #100 gift cards. Overall, the game was interesting and action-packed if you kept betting higher amounts. Very cute game! Lorraine Andriuk 🌈","Follow up post- After having to continue to go out of site and re-enter after ads popped up 6/7 times, I decided to just play high as I could to get rid of the coins and uninstall the game. I do not mind the ads, as most sites send you back to your game, but this site keep you hostage on the ad page as if to make you download it. It is a terrible glitch because all the games are great, the ads making you exit out is really terrible.","I gave this app a 2 star because the game itself is awesome, however the ads are annoying. You can be in the middle of a game and an ad pops up. There shouldn't be so many ads. It really ruins the fun of the game. The graphics and payouts are great. DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE ADS! I'm going to delete this game. It's a shame because it's fun. It would be more enjoyable without so many ads.","Its a great game, i dont like the ads, gets on my nerves, change them, good job guys, i like the back round colors and the way this game is put togather, i think your players might enjoy this app, so if you change a few things to make it more enjoyable for players you guys might get 8 or 9 stars for this app","I understand that there will be ads, and I would have given a higher star but the ads have really become a problem. Everytime I am in a bonus round an ad pops up and I can't get back to the game and I have to close it entirely and reopen everything. This happens contantly. I am getting really tired of having to close the casino and reopen it because of the ads. Maybe you can fix your games so we can get back from the ad without closing the game completely. I may uninstall because of this."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jmsgame.jackpotmastercasino","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jmsgame.jackpotmastercasino&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Streamer Life!","description":"Welcome to the life of an influencer!\r\n\r\nDo you dream of becoming a famous influencer?

I can get into the game now, thanks! I paid to remove ads but they're still there 😢. Please update with a fix for ads so I can enjoy the game in a laid back, ad free environment. Thanks!!!!*** Character creation works and then when I hit the \"Go Live\" button it goes to a blank white screen with a banner ad at the bottom and stays there. The game won't load. I'll leave it installed for a bit and hope an update comes out quickly to fix the problem. Thanks! 🙏","I installed the game after seeing the ad which made me think this game would be fantastic. Boy, was I disappointed. First off, NONE OF THE STUFF FROM THE ADS ACTUALLY HAPPENS. And second, after I reached level five, clicking the play button didn't work. So I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game, twice. Just a blank grey screen both times. Never thought a game that looked so cool could be such a piece of garbage. Major let-down, and wouldn't function properly. Doesn't even deserve a star.","It's a really fun game and I enjoy playing it, but one thing: this game is not E for everyone. On no chance will it ever be E for everyone. There are a lot of ads too and the levels start repeating which Is annoying. But otherwise I like the game. Also one last thing: the levels repeat and that's really annoying I recommend making more levels.","I'm only giving the game 3 stars for one reason, I downloaded this app and when I restarted it, it wouldn't let me play, I pressed the button to play, a bunch of times but it still dosen't let me play sadly, the ads don't bother me alot, but the fact that it dosen't let me play after RESTARTING the app is honestly just disappointing.","The game is fun but after a couple of levels they repeat the levels it's stops being fun after that. There is one level that the girl takes off her shirt but you can't see her .... Don't think kids should play this. I would love to see more of this game in the future and hope that u can give this 5 stars.

An exit never pops up, it only brings me to the store, and I have to close out the game and reload it if I want to keep playing. I'm one more ad away from deleting the stupid thing.","Trying to say a lot of things about this game that it won't let you get past level 14 or 15 cuz by the time you're about to win it comes with a commercial so what's the sense of happiness game if you cannot play it and it won't let you add friends or invite friends so what is the sense of this game is stupid whoever made the game want me to go back and fix a whole bunch of things","I enjoy this game, the concept and the graphics. However, when you get to a certain point you have to spend money to advance. Watching a 30 second ad only gets you 2 gems. You need 100 gems to buy boosters. Be more considerate of our time, especially when some levels are impossible without boosters. I have spent some money but the higher the level the more money it seems like I need to spend. Also, in some levels the items are too small/light colored and hard to see when playing on a phone.","I was pretty addicted to this game for several weeks, and am at level 300. I didn't give it one star because it is an engaging game, and the worlds are pretty fun and well developed. But in the higher levels, you earn less coins per level, making it really difficult to \"purchase\" upgrades for the kitchen, which makes it almost impossible to get through some of the levels without using a booster, or using diamonds to get increased time or more customers. This isn't fun anymore, I'm uninstalling","Very fun, addictive game until about level 25 or 30, when the ads begin in earnest; the levels are relatively short, and there is now an ad after every single level that lasts as long as the level itself. There are also sometimes long ads after simply collecting a reward, an act which takes mere seconds. Very annoying and honestly not worth continuing unless you're very patient and have a lot of time on your hands."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.biglime.cookingmadness","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.biglime.cookingmadness&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Space Force - Lightsaber Game","description":"Build amazing realistic lightsabers and destroy and beat everything you see in the new Space Force game!

One is that you let players put pieces in any order (e.g. hilt above guard). Second, the build menu from which you drag your pieces is a bit cluttered once you unlock all the pieces. Third, the dark crystal doesn't look at all like it does on screen. Last but not least, more pieces for building. But, like I said at the start, I think this is a great game, and I am sure these things are only because it is in early access","So many ads! It's a fun game and I enjoy building and playing but every time you do anything you get another video ad. Die, get an ad. Open a gift, get an ad. Finish a level, get an ad, even if you don't opt to watch the video for extra credits. I'm watching ads more than I play. Which is pretty sad, because the game is actually fun. If I could pay for an ad-free experience, I would. Especially since I sometimes accidentally tap on the ad instead of X and tabbing back crashes the game.","This game is pretty fun. It has decent graphics and is pretty addictive to play. My only issue is that when you beat the game, it just makes you repeat the final level over and over and over. I feel like having the ability to go back to old levels would be better than repeating the same level several times. Other than that, I say it's a pretty good game.","Pretty good. It never gets boring as there's new levels with different designs and new creatures. Could you add a \"market\" where you can make sabers and sell them. (Like the occasional quest which you can decline) I'm sure many people would like it and you can use it to make money. It would also be cool if you add more parts. Then you could sell parts and buy new parts for new sabers. It would be epic.","Could use better part organization. When you own everything, it's all in one huge pile, so it would be nice to have every kind of piece separated into different trays. One for endcaps in one, grips in another, etc. It's impossible to find what you're looking for otherwise. Also, put ads on the end of levels, not in the middle of creating a saber/blaster."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.majorfrank.saberforce","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.majorfrank.saberforce&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Ball Run 2048","description":"This is the best 2048 ball game you will ever play! \r\nThis action-packed puzzle game is so fun.

Or if you have literally nothing better to do.","I love the game but 4 problems: 1. It's a low effort game but still really fun! 2. There is no level select, you just go on to the next level. 3. You can't pay to remove ads but at least there aren't too many annoying ads. 4. Some of the levels just started seeming to repeat (Starting at Level 31, I'm currently on 32). Other than that it's good and I still recommend buying it if you want!","This game is fun and satisfying, but after a few levels it gets kind of boring. If you don't want TOO much ads, just turn on mobile data or airplane mode, it will work. This game also has to much ads which makes it boring after a few levels. Each level is different, but the same balls. After all it's very good!! Have a good day/ night. Hope this review helped. :)","You will spend more time looking at ads than you will in the game. There's no menu and no way to retry levels at all, it's just a relentless push towards completing the level as fast as possible to get you back to the ads. It doesn't seem like theres any meaning behind the scoring either as I never had a bad score send me to redo a level. There's an ad after every single level and they're all about 15-20 seconds","They made a major mistake with this game. You cannot play without internet, even though the game is completely appropriate, fun, and challenging (I enjoyed it for what it is) I cannot let my kids enjoy it because the ads are sooo inappropriate. How does it go from help these people undress ads to free Jesus coloring pages ad. Also if I am somewhere without internet, can't play it at all... unfortunate.

I've played ss for more than 3 years now on my phone. I'm getting an update to an iphone 12 so I'm going to miss playing on the phone I'm using which Is the iphone 8. The same ly problem I have with the game is that is pretty easy to beat, such as you earn coins and you can buy all the characters you want. Yet the new updateakes it even easier to \"finish\", the game when you earn the coin things you can exchange them for it's such as key, coins exc . But overall I recommend playing","Very fun game it's hard to get on the leaderboard like to get to diamond and it swipes me off the game every time I try to swap left or right but it's a good game the reason it's four stars and not five because there's like a lot of ads when you turn your internet on and it's a little bit annoying so please don't make it a lot of ads and I feel like it would be a lot more views in five stars so please fix that have a good day bye.","This game is great. I usually get bored with games after a short time but I've been playing this one for over a year. The first time I played it since I was eight, was after a hurricane in my area. It helped me get my mind off of all of the destruction and I personally enjoy collecting the characters. I've seen some reviews say that the characters do the same thing and there's nothing really unique about them except their look. I agree it would be nice if they had advantages, overall great game!","Fun, great way to pass the time but freezes a lot lately and you lose the coins you got. Been a few times now where I was on my way to high score for the week and didn't get it because of game freezing when trying to watch videos. Please fix Happened again today. So Frustrating putting in all that time for it to freeze on a video. And all support does is send you the same generic support response. How about you just fix the problem. Been playing for years and am close to deleting this game","I had rate the subway surfers many times never rate less 5 stars. This is my first favorite game. In the event that end today I had Player Akira and the board Sakura. When I got akira. After 3 days later I completed the hunt. I was waiting for next event. But my problem is only that when the event is going to end please make the event and the time is end,please post the event without waiting a minute.

For most cosmetic items in this game you have to watch 3 ads for each thing (different hair color, dress, head accessories, ect.)

I do enjoy this game, however the ads are a bit excessive.","Too many ads. It has an ad when it is a new game. And when I hit the second chance button and if I watch the whole ad, it doesn't give me my award. And some of the turns when I click the second chance button it says \"Ad is not ready\".

There's also an ad after basiclly everything, and more mini games than actual trading. You also have to watch an ad to have a second chance on trading if you decline or get declined, if you don't you get another random minigame. So I think if they were to update the game to have some minigames, but not more than actual trading, and have less ads.","Horrible Horrible!!!! 1 : too many ads 2: heats up the device 3 freezes at random times and 4 takes a long time to load!!!!!!!! Don't waste your time getting this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Terrible! I wish the rating could be a 0 could've been better.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Lovely game, but too many ads😪 This would be an even better game without so many ads and maybe even an update. An update so that u can trade without it saying \"That's wrong\" or whatever. Anyway I would've given it five stars but I told what I think. Anyway four stars. Lovely game😊 Edit: I would like the update also so u can trade for as long to as u want☺","This game is so annoying, even though my sister loves I don't because after doing a task it takes me strait into an add it is so annoying, it even happens when there is a prize and you don't press the \"watch an add and you will get the prize\" token. It also provides no noise when you press the pop it. It also only provided a the figet trading part every 5 or so so tasks.😡😠😩😿. So can you please change that or else I will delete it."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.FidgetTrading3D.game","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FidgetTrading3D.game&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Toca Life World: Build stories & create your world","description":"Create stories and build your own world with Toca Life World.

But like everything costs money. Maybe make it like things are free, but very goods things cost money. Because I have wanted alot of things overtime and can't get them. Me and my siblings play each day and can't get the things we want. Maybe you can make jobs, and that would be very entertaining, and then give money (fake) and then you can buy stuff. Because I have read reports and they say about this to. So please make atleast some items free. I love the game though!!","Toca life world is a wonderful game, it is easy to use and child safe. However, i have given it 4 stars because of a glitch that i do not know how to fix. I have made two custom characters, but I can only get one to appear at a time. one will appear, but when i edit the other one so it appears as well the first one vanishes, and can't be found under the stop sign menu. in addition, there are a lot, and i mean a lot of in app purchases, and there is almost nothing for free to play users.","I love Toca but there's one thing I HATE!! Toca glitches a lot and sometimes my things disappear I got the dimple inside the pencil pouch and started playing with it the next day it disappeared! I checked everywhere but it's gone! The same thing happened with my banana pj's except I found it in the post office. I WANT MY DIMPLE BACK!!!!!! I also think more things should be free and that there should be more hair and clothes! Only 10 percent of the game is free the other 90 isn't!!!","I love the app but it is a bit laggy. Like when I was going onto a place, I took like 10 minutes to load. But other than that, it is a great app! I think you should add: You can play with friends, a tab at the top of the screen and if you press it you can add friends and see if they are online, if you want to make people pay for this update, I say make is €5 £5 $5 A library Some more shops A school supplies shop More school supplies","I LOVE THIS GAME. I play it for hours straight and my only problem is that it takes up space, but other than that there is nothing else. And i highly recomend it because it dosent need wifi, and is very entertaning.

And we didn't get anything for watching ads. Creater only get money but it's wasting our time!!!!","Fun with a clever and unique concept. You can play offline or you can watch an ad when you want a special power which is a fair trade in my opinion. You do kill your opponent and they fall to pieces, so I don't recommend for kids under ten. The art is cute but could use some refining and the levels do get repetitive and playing for a while gets boring. However, it's amusing enough to play casually for a bit each day as a time killer. The powers from the hand gestures are unexpected and cool.","I just started the game and played a few lvls. And I would say that if I was able to give stars for how much this pissed me off then it would have been 5 starts just because I could not give more. The game itself if awesome, i liked it alot but how much ads it is shoving down your throat for you to buy ad free is insane. The thing that pissed me off beyond words is that this offline game can't be played without Internet. To make such a good game and put it so down the gutter is stupid.","I had played many games but this game has soo many ads that u thought that it would be if you click start button then one ad starts and when the game ends or u pause then resume the game then again one ad and when u go to shop and then click back to menu then again one ad i played this game 2 hours and I show about 45 ads I think and that's too much"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.YsoCorp.NinjaHands","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.YsoCorp.NinjaHands&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Magnum Quest","description":"An Imaginative IDLE RPG.

So for this to get 3 stars shows just how good the graphics, UI and overall presentation is. So that said, I've never been more mad at a game. This game looks so good and is smooth to operate yet you do nothing really. You spend your time leveling up heroes just to then watch them fight. I play games to actually play them. If I wanted to watch I'd put on Netflix. Please please make there more to do in battles. It's worth it!","Crispy graphics. I love the D&D tabletop setup of the game. I just enjoy the background view in this game. As far as gameplay, it's your standard heroes captcha games. Gather Heroes, level them up, gear them up and take on adventures, hunts, raids, arena and guilds. No bugs or any issues encountered yet. Pros to the Devs!","Absolutely loving this game. The combat system is similar to Summoners War: Lost Centuria, without the cheap counter attacks. There's plenty of heroes to collect, and a ton of team combinations. I've only been playing for about 8 hours, so I'm not too far into the game, but I can say for certain this game will stay on my phone.","Really enjoying this one!! Its kinda the same theme as \"AFK-Arenas\" but better grafix and character designs! There's a mass amount of goodies,/,rewards that are given everyday and always something to do to earn towards character development!! Thanks guys!! I'll be sticking around this one for awhile!!","It's a really good clone of the other games of the same genre. Graphics are good, gameplay is smooth, and the interface is awesome with the table-top DnD theme.

It is mostly about luck, the physics are terrible, you can hit the most unrealistic ludicrous shots and it is very much pay to win. Although you can legitimately progress it is hard, annoying and not worth it, especially when you could spend 20 quid and be somewhere which could take you weeks to months. I feel like if the game physics were much more like real pool and everyone used the same cue then it would be enjoyable","Was one of my most favourite game but now the most terrible as it makes me lose my money instead of earning them just because of a glitch. On many occasions the opponent surprisingly gets a chance to hit the ball even after his/her time is lapsed which is unfair according to the rules of the game. I expect you to be quick and fix the glitch.","Great game, high value games should have dual confirmation on selection. I am also experiencing a problem to get rewards, I have to keep on logging in and out to watch a video to get each reward. You may say at miniclip 8 ball pool that you do not interfere with games played but I can assure you that majority of your players know that you mislead your supporters that are trying to use your services. Why is it everytime I get a social media message connection to 8 ball cancels.","All over game is very good. But there are two things that I didn't like, 1) there should be 'no guideline' tournament too. So that it will become bit hard and many times without even getting a chance, my opponent won many finals. So if there will be no guideline, then the game will become bit harder and both the opponents get enough chances to win the game. 2) other thing is you must give option to change the name in game. I am not able to change my name right now. So please make It possible.","I have uninstalled and reinstalled this game several times and played with guest login everytime and found a common pattern.... initially you will start getting points coins and every rewards and then gradually you will start observing that you are getting some impossible positions constantly and start loosing. Which in turn sometimes makes you desperate and provokes you to spend money. The trick is when you feel this, uninstall and reinstall, you will start winning again.My opinion :)."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.miniclip.eightballpool","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miniclip.eightballpool&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Fat 2 Fit!","description":"All sizes are wonderful and necessary to win the game!\r\nChoose your diet wisely to ensure you can clear the obstacles and reach the finish line.

The game is SUPER pay to win! Skill is not required and the whole game is a numbers game. Even if you had the skill and patience, a timer will make sure you fail. It's clear the devs wish to hide this as well with the removal of my review. The delay with the servers is awful, along with hit detection. You'll either get hit by something that didn't touch you, or you'll be hit by something that did touch you in .5-1.5+ seconds later. PvP is also massively unbalanced.","Great game and an awesome pass time. Leveling up is a breeze and upgrading weapons is simple and fair. PVP didn't take long to be taken over by hackers and whales, while some modes like one life mode is just broken. In One Life mode, you have to figure out how to get manual aim to work, otherwise the entire mode is riddled with poorly placed enemies that will hit you no matter what you do, because either their hit boxes are too large for their design, or because they appear out of nowhere.","Game is fun BUT the Story Mode progression is so heavily reliant on level requirements it ruins the desire to play after level 40. Basically it's a pay wall and if you want to play more you better cough up real life money. No, I won't, and when a game restricts things this ridiculously it's not worth investing in because it's just a matter of time before you have to pay and pay.","Terrible. Yes the controls are almost good enough, the graphics are pretty nice. BUT I WANT TO PLAY CONTRA. INSTEAD...I have to spend 30 minutes raiding previous levels so I can advance and PLAY another level, else I should pay for extra lvl'ing so my character is leveled enough TO PLAY THE NEXT LEVEL?!?! What?! So I blow through stages 1-3 never even get touched, but im 3 levels away from being allowed to play the next level? It's dumb. I want to play contra. This isn't contra.","This could have been good. There is controller support, I guess? But it stopped working after the tutorial level. I also can't support games with gacha mechanics. This doesn't feel like Contra. It feels like a poorly made mobile game with a license from Konami. The load times are also pretty atrocious. I was hoping for better, especially after Konami released Castlevania Symphony of the Night on Android.

It gets old. Dressing her up gets way too monotonous and time consuming after a couple times. Why should we have to watch ads to use power ups we already earned? And why bother giving options if there's only one choice or the games going to do what it wants anyway? Even if you deny Alex you still have to date him? Give us other options. Not to mention the objectification of women. We have to dress to impress and gain the approval of a man? Seriously? No thanks.","The game itself is ok but theres way to many ads and notifications, the notifications are so clingy as well I played the game then about 3 hours later I got a notification that said \"I miss u\" that's ok when the last time you played like 2 days ago but 3 hours is way too clingy also theres too many adverts, I felt like I was watching more adverts than playing the game, yes there is an ad free option but I refuse to use my money on a game This is my opinion on the game and you might love it","It's bad, but not really really bad. I have to work so hard and watch so many ads just to get a short clip of what happens ! It is very annoying. Also, please lower the price of the things. Why should I pay for the things she wants ? Please give us more ability to do things. Also, please make the clips more longer and make us have more options.","As long as I am dressing glamorous or business or dates between men and women I will play it for hours a day. I have played one day for 7 hours. I would like a skip button that cost maby 500 jewels for ones I don't want to do. This just covers everyone's personal choice. Or a opt out for people who only want romantic dates with same sex or opposite sex partners would be more inclusive, and maybe pick a relateble race, I am sure black and brown people would rather dress their own skin color I do","Going to uninstall the game!

When I went through the tutorial and was throwing the trash cans across the street I didn't know I was doing it all wrong! Task is to empty the trash and set the can back down. Unlike the cans you'll have to release any free items once above the truck. Enjoy","I love this game! The controls aren't hard to use and the difficulty is perfect. One thing though. I closed the app after getting lots of progress, but when I opened it again all of my progress was lost. If this gets fixed I'll definitely rate this game a five star. Overall, pretty good app!","I made it decently far into the game and had to stop playing for a few hours. I logged back on a few hours layer and all my progress was gone. I really wanted to give this game 5 stars but I just can't if it is going to delete my progress everytime I leave the game. Edit: I was just about to give you five stars but, what happens? All of my progress was gone. 2 entire days worth. Please fix this! I love this game but it's just unplayable.","The game is honestly very fun and doesn't need wifi so you can play anywhere! But one problem.. I was on the 5x Truck $10,000 and I closed the app and when I joined back it restarted EVERYTHING days of work and I lost it all can you fix and give my truck back please? Once this is fixed, My rating will be 5 stars. Thanks for reading!","Amazing game. I would greatly recommend. But I almost all upgrades and game was lagging so I closed it and it reopened it and deleted all my progress without a way to get my progress back. Please fix this and I will edit my review and make it a 5 star.

Now it more of a stress reliever. The game developers have reduce the strength of the players ability to get to the other levels. And have made it more difficult to gain rewards to advance, unless you spend money to improve your craft. And with the purchases of the player, they have reduced the ability of the craft's new abilities. And the new updates restrict further. I'm almost at my tolerance of this game.","40th level is not possible to pass without using gems. If you don't have gem means you have to pay for it. Game is looting you. You will definitely disappointed in 40th level because how mach you try you will not pass it without gem. I like to tell the developer learn from subway surfer, temple run and candy crush they giving amazing features with no money. They are not beggers like you. That's why they got so many downloads. It's a casual game not challenging like pubg you have to give features","Beware! The developer of this game has no intention of ever fixing the numerous bugs and glitches that have plagued this game for over a year. Every update adds additional p2w features, and invariably another bug that renders a previously-functional feature inoperative. This game used to be great; I used to give it 5-stars, but has been a mess for about a year now. I'm done with it.","This is a fun game to play that takes a bit of effort to upgrade the aircrafts without paying money. Do all your quests on lower settings to get as many gems as possible and farm some good equipment (there's items that give +15%gold and +5% more event item) graphics could be better but it's fun game. I see a lot of people say you can't play the game without paying they are just too lazy or impatient. In about a year I got three tier 2 planes and ones fully maxed. There's no need to spend money.","Was once a great game until it became more about how much $$ they can get and how little effort they have to put into support, refunding double charges, player complaints. They are content with the glitches with the game as long as they can add more useless features no one actually cares about. Even when u have a legit complaint they tell u try harder or get some skill. Been double charged on my debit card and they refuse to refund the $$ to my account.

A Subway flyer with a picture of its food? I dont know how else to describe it. I am not going to give higher ratings until you fix the game.","The older version was better and I prefer the older version's set up. I hate the ads on the course that I'm trying to play b/c it causes lag and when it starts to get fast you cant so anything b/c of the amount of lag. When i played this a few years ago, it was alot of fun and there weren't any ads in the course and it eas acually enjoyable, but with the ads now it is really hard to play the further on you go.","It's fun...I loved it alot I never get bored. But if you will play it everyday than I don't know you will like it or not. It has a variety of different songs. I agree it has a disadvantage that it don't have 'all' songs but still I love it...c'mon we get to explore different songs...sorry I just wrote an essay 😝...anyways I recommend it once...hope it helped...stay safe, take care everyone.","Don't get me wrong it's a great game I would play this all the time, IF THERE WASN'T 100000 ADS. I cant be bothered to watch a 30sec long ad and if I don't I get one anyways. I understand that this how they make profit but there are to many would give it 5 if not for the ads but I'm going to stick with 3, maybe if they take 50% of the ads or make them shorter I will keep playing but until then I'm staying away from this game goodbye...","great game with great songs but there r a bunch of stuff which is quite rlly annoying 1•u have to watch ads to unlock a song ,even before getting the score n pretty obv for getting a revive 2• the game feels pretty rigged at a point coz I have a rly great networks connections setup n stuff but the game glitches at the point of chorus. Also the diamonds aren't able to unlock new songs they feel useless coz am not interested in wasting them on balls.

However, the puzzles are extremely simple that a toddler could solve them. Let alone, there is no music or background music making this experience more brain numbing. With the gameplay aside, the app is bombarded with ads. If god forbid you enjoy this game please turn on the airplane mode to avoid the ads.","I'm on level 52. There were a couple times I thought I was stuck, but I took a break and came back and was able to finish. I play with internet connection turned off, and I really do enjoy the game. I can tell from the 2 times I forgot to turn off wi-fi that I would have uninstalled this immediately if turning off internet didn't stop the ads.","It's a very fun game, but sometimes it doesn't save my progress and really has too many ads, *dies in wave of ads* so very many ads. I love the game overall, but I would recommend less ads. I've been restarting on level 27. I'm actually on level 30. I'd really love if you didn't have to purchase zero ads as well. Overall very fun and timekilling game.","I got to level 705, and loved relaxing with this game. I paid for this, but now I regret it with the sheer number of ads I have to play just to reveal the colors and then solve the puzzle. What's the point to these changes?!! I quit. I HATE THE CHANGES TO THIS GAME. Such a shame with the update. Hope they change it back someday. As it is now, I do not recommend playing this game even for free. Before, I would recommend paying for this game. Such a difference. 5 star game is now 1 star. 😔","Not a good game. Sounds are terrible, they didn't even bother adding musics, drains battery insanely even when it's charging, phone gets hot even if the game has not much of graphics, and there is hidden colors levels which after a point get too difficult to solve(that seems they make you to watch an ad to get an empty bottle).

You could claim them when you need them. I wonder why \" King\" does not read our reviews and reply?","It is such a great game! One of the features I like is having an account because your progress is saved so if you were to switch devices you could just carry on. Another feature I really like is that you can go back and do the levels again. Great game - a must get for everyone that likes candy and challenges.","Don't give your children to play this games. It will give pressure to your children's mind. You only get 5 lives and if you want to buy lives you have to buy gold bars, and this will effect your children's mind.

This is not an online game whatsoever they make it look online by having names over all the bots you would expect real people to use. The only part you could argue is online would be the leaderboards but that does not make it an online game","The game is fun and amazing But there are a lot of advertisements, every time I want to play a game, after each game there are 2-3 advertisements, there is also no revive option, Why???????????????? Please fix this and if possible then can there please be less advertisements. We also play with bots Why can't real people play against each other If humans would play together, maybe it would be much better because bots keep killing us and like above, after game,there is ad,its useless with ads.","Ads every time you die, ads to play, ads to end rounds... we get it, you want money. I downloaded an ad-blocker specifically because of this game. The controls aren't spot on and neither are the snakes mapping. I've been hit head on by smaller snakes and died while they played on. 3 out of 10 for gameplay, the ads knock it down to a -3.","Fantastic game! A game that keeps you focused and occupied for long periods of time. It could be better if there was a pause function because it can really be very bad for the eyes to continue playing and focusing for long periods of time.","I love love love snake io you can earn a bunch of points and get your own character no matter what it is. I was looking for the dragon one and I got it after only a day. Plus when u start the game u can get 2 free characters. I would recommend this game. 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀.

Now it's not a puzzle game anymore; now it's basically a maze game where you can only see one space ahead and have to watch an ad every time you want to backtrack. I'm gonna uninstall it now. I was on level 2225 too (which means I've watched over 2000 ads already). Such a shame that they changed it to something I hate so much that I decided never to play it again.","I want my money back!!! This WAS a brilliant brain teaser, for which I happily paid to be advert-free... Until some utter toss-pots have decided this would be so much better if replaced strategy with random moves by hiding the colour of most balls. Uninstalled after reaching level 980 as this is about as attractive as stale vomit now. I hope no one actually got paid for trashing this once brilliant game.","Previous review had been 5 stars. Thanks to a recent update that fundamentally changes the way the game is played, i discovered there is a plethora of games almost identical to this available on the play store. I may return if they ever decide to bring back the puzzle aspect of the game that they sacrificed in lieu of a pure chance game.","I really liked the game however ads were all very long and did not allow you to exit after 5 seconds. I really liked this game but now I get ads that simply will not close!,,, I can not continue playing. Very frustrating so good bye. Sorrydevelopers cannot do bettet","I really enjoy the game as a whole. I find it very nice to sort things and work out the puzzles. I enjoy it so much that I paid to have no ads very early on, yet I keep getting ads when I try to undo my moves. I let the ad run to see if the game thinks I wanted an additional tube, but I never get one. This is a huge inconvenience for me, and I'm not getting what I paid for. There's also the issue of the new levels where you can't see all the balls.

But if all the fidgets were unlocked it could've been better, and for the sounds of the fidgets it was not bad but if they were more realistic I would've given it 5 stars. But I still think u should get this app if u dont have a fidget. I hope my review helps. Thanks for reading.","It's a good game. Nothing special. Alot of options, and while not all of them are fidget toys they're still entertaining. I recommends it, sure it has ads but they don't bother me atleast and there isn't alot of them. I'm sure some could calm down from anxiety or anything else using this game, i mean, everyone is different, but i just use it to pass the time.","I really like this app! Whenever I'm frustrated, Fidgety, or having anxiety I go on my phone to this app. It has alot of different fidgets, And it also has sound and is very satisfying. Although I can't feel it I still love the sound. There's a few negative things though. After almost every time you try to exit out of a fidget it gives you a ad that is at least 15 seconds long. It also is alittle slow when you try to exit out of the app for me. That is my opinion, and why j gave it a 3/5","Honestly, other than the UNHOLY amount of adds, this is a fun game. There are lots of options of fidgets, and its nice to be able to experience the fidgets without having to buy them. Which is nice, because I can't afford fidgets. So if you want to enjoy some fidgets, you should get this game. Just beware, there are TONS of adds",".LOVEE THISS APP. It is an amazing app and everything is free , I know ads are normal for free games but the amount of ads is unbelievable yet I still play it at 3 am but most of the time I need to turn off my internet or be on airplane mode that is more irritating cause you will not receive your messages BUT IT IS AMAZING!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.cdgames.fidget3d","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cdgames.fidget3d&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"The Superhero League","description":"With great power comes great fun!

Not going to lie, my favorite is the guy with telekinesis. I've only failed once so far. Missions are not that rage inducing (for me). And I give it a 5 star. Because I have no complaints what so ever.","Everyone is complaining about ads, but I'm not getting ads at all, but what is annoying is that when i try to get an award or another chapter, it says no video available. What also sucks is that I can only get like 2 characters, which explains the ad problem. Other than that it really isn't a bad game. I would give it 4-5 stars if they fix this problem.","I really did like the game exept for a few things. 1: Cant use any other heroes because it doesnt give me an option too 2: And whenever I want to watch an add to unlock them it say there is no videos available . :3 Keep up the hard work (also if u could fix these issues that would be GREATLY apprieciated) P.S I dont like the ads but there is a reasonabke amount so if u see a review saying that \"the adds are to much\" or something like that think to yourself its a free game they get profitfromads","Fine game! Though the ads are bogus, I didn't ecoieve to see a very decent game! It's so nice, and gorgeous! I like the first abilities you get, controlling other things and people. It's amusing and actually wonderful for an ad! I hope this game gets circulated around the broad world named as a worthy-time-waster! To lessen these passages, I love this game and it should be famous. Thank you for developing this game!","I downloaded the game, and played through enough levels to decide it'd be worth paying the 2.99 to not have to deal with ads. A couple hours later, though, and it won't open AT ALL. I tried deleting it and redownloading it, and that worked for a bit, but now it's doing it again. Actual game plays more interesting than some other cheap puzzle games out there, but at least the other basic puzzle games FUNCTION."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.onebutton.mrsuper","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onebutton.mrsuper&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Coin Master","description":"Join your Facebook friends and millions of players around the world in attacks, spins and raids to build your viking village to the top! \r\n\r\nDo you have what it takes to be the next Coin Master?

Otherwise, it's an enjoyable way to pass time. Maybe a few less pop-ups when the spins run out would help. Also if we could win more coins with our spins it might not seem so hopeless to complete a village. Thanks for a fun game!","A good friend of mines recommended this app, don't get me wrong it's fun, it help kill time if you are waiting somewhere or if your on a break, with that being said, I would give this app 5 stars but, there are issues with the game loading, especially when you sign on and have to wait for the rewards to load or when you attack a village or steal coins, if it decides to load after that, it's a miracle, most of the time I have to restart the app, if this get fixed, 5 stars all day 👋🏼","The game is good and addictive. The parts of the game I don't like. If you trade cards for chests. You have to unclick the cards you want to keep then reclick the one's you want to trade. It would be better if the cards are left unclicked. Leave it up to the player to choose the cards instead of wasting our time also you do not get any advance notice of any gold card events. That's the only time you can trade gold cards. Gold cards that are in a gold card event shouldn't have a limit on them.","Love love this game. But lately it seems I can't get ahead for anything. I know that happens from time to time but this seems to pe a pattern for the last 4 months. The bonus spins always land on the lowest coins, when win anything if at all its the lowest it can possibly be. And the freebies I get in my email have also been usually just low coins or coins and 10 spins. I need spins so please check to see if there is a glitch somewhere. Thanks","I have been playing for just over a month. The game is fun when you have spins. I have very few friends who play. I think you need to have a way to get some more spins easier. Let's look at today because I got some decent spins from the bonus bar, in total I had about 6 billion coins. I bought cards trying to complete some sets. I DID NOT get one new card, and I need about 20 gold cards and 6 white cards to complete sets, to get the spins to make the game fun."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.moonactive.coinmaster","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moonactive.coinmaster&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Garena Free Fire - 4nniversary","description":"Free Fire is the ultimate survival shooter game available on mobile.

I like this game so much. But one problem is. Why this game more update line so slow. My line is always problem. My internet the speed is 4x. But when i play this game from 7pm untill 12 am. Ping always 100 untill 999+. Please fix this problem. I dont want to stay untill 3Am just for play this game. I hope your developer can fix this problem.","I used to play this game everyday. It was the best game! Now it sucks. The game lags and freezes. The new update it trash. It keeps taking me out of the game. And I can't even play with my friends. This has only been happening ever seen the new update. Please fix it. There are so many complains about this but it hasn't be fixed?? What the hell??","Honest review is it is not free fire it is glitch fire. Everytime I play the game I am being eliminated without any reason,and the mic issue you can't talk with your friends. I have spent a lot of money in this game to just suffer from glitches. I try to make custom rooms and it shows room full. Updates are coming but the developer isn't developing the game after update they give us the old glitches with some more glitches. Remove vector from the game","It is very good game but It has a problem that when I open this game it say 'NETWORK CONNECTION ERROR' and when I am playing a match after few minutes it says 'connection error' and I released that other online games and app is working perfect on wifi. I have been playing free fire since last 3 year.Please solve this problem.

The only reason I gave it a 3 is because of ADS. When you switch from store/home to music list it plays an ad. When you want to continue after you missed one.....plays an ad. The ads are long too. Even if you pass and before it brings you back to the song list, guess what? It plays an ad. Too many ads and it took away from an awesome game.","This is a fun game, but there is a problem. The ads. Too many ads. Want to start the song where you failed? Watch an ad. Don't want to start where you failed? Watch an ad before starting back at the beginning. What would be a 4 star game is a 1 star game because of the constant ads. Some are several MINUTES long, and can't be skipped. I would consider paying to remove the ads if there were more good songs. My suggestion (even though it'll be ignored) is to dial down the ads, and add more songs.","I would give this a 4 stars, if not 3. I find it really fun when you change colors, the elegant songs, and the bass/beat of it. BUT the ads..I'm complaining about this because there are too much ads! Although, I can just put my wifi off, it's hard to cope with. And i find it a bit too easy but i guess i recommend. That's all, thanks.","5/5 great game. I do have some ideas though of what small changes that could leave a big but positive impact. So when you download the app and open it, there should be a (pop-up) that says select language and after that brings up one more (pop-up)that says preferred music and the pop-up shows selections of different genres and you can select them. And if you wanna explore new genres as a user, you can. These are just ideas but feel free to input them.","This is the best game ever it's super fun has good music and it sounds way better with headphones as suggested by the game and there are not much adds and no adds pop up while you are in a game and when you get adds in home screen there are only five seconds.

But I'm giving it 3 out of 5 stars because, 1) The ads: some you can't Exit out of and you don't get your coins. 2) To remove the Ads is $5.99 That's greedy. Just because its free to play doesn't mean you have the right to charge that much. I want to buy to remove ads but I'm not paying that much. 3) Your prices for coins etc Are too expensive. 4) FIX THESE THINGS AND YOU'LL HAVE MORE PPL PLAYING. NO NEED TO BE GREEDY.","So was enjoying the game. Its a nice easy, no pressure, after a hard work day. Then an ad pops up, that's ok the developers need to pay bills too...when the ads wants you to play.....which I don't want...watch is ok...not playing. And so I left Zen match and it won't let me LOAD their game anymore....hummm....guess I will choose another game then...","It's Mahjong with an extra step: room decorating. It's not a terrible game. It pretends to be ad free, but around puzzle 10, the ads start and don't stop; an ad after every level. Plus, the game is on a stupid heart system, so if you mess up more than five times, you have to wait half an hour. I understand that mobile game companies want to slow the players down so they don't fly through their game, but that's a lot of wait time, and really, the waiting ruins the experience for the player. 5/10","The game play in the beginning is not like the ad. For reference the ad has a giant board with only 3 spaces to place the pieces. Aside from that this game does not let you collect rewards unless you keep returning to the home menu, as someone who wants play the game seamlessly it is annoying. After 2 levels are completed and you haven't returned to the home menu, instead of allowing you to go to the next level you are forced to the home screen to collect your rewards. Please fix next update.","I love the game itself, but the ads are OVERKILL!! I understand the need for ads, but this is ridiculous. Before/after every level, before you can decorate a room, etc. It kills the Zen this game might create. Also, several of the ads freeze and I have to force-close the app, which is frustrating. I also don't appreciate the game forcing me to stop playing levels to go decorate the rooms, because it also forces yet another ad..."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.exoticmatch.game","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.exoticmatch.game&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"MiniCraft: Blocky Craft 2021","description":"Do you love building games?

Before this happened, I had 8,200 coins. When I got it opened back up, I only had 7,600. I lost 800 coins because of that crash, and that's not the only time it's happened.","So much fun! Learning lots of trivia. This game keeps you on your toes and brings back lots of good memories! I learn something new everyday! Graphics are great. Nice & colorful! Learning lots about music! Was afraid to pick categories I wasn't sure of, but it's been great learning new things! I love the new Characters that have been added! New ways to earn rewards are being added! I can do this all day. Something new added daily.","This game is fun. It starts out easy and gradually gets tougher. I like the way it gives you options for getting more stuff by watching videos or buying. If you don't like the ads then it's only 3 bucks. I like to challenge myself by not buying anything or watching extra videos for stuff. Not very many ads and I know I didn't buy my answers! I streaked to 79! Lots of fun!","Lots of questions on a wide range of subjects. A really good game to spend your time on. And even if you don't know all the Answers you are still learning. Wha snot to like. Still loving this game. It's my go to if I am bored. Still playing. Enjoying myself. Keeping my brain ticking over and learning while I am at it.Still playing Still enjoying and learning at the same time. 👍 If you are feeling bored with nothing to do. Try this game as it's fun and it is good for you..Still loving this game.","I'm enjoying this game. Luckily many of the questions aren't ridiculously hard like some other trivia games I've played. What I've found though after playing this for a month, what it cost to play each question is many times more than you can earn. I keep losing more coins than I earn so I will have to get rid of this game very soon."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.trivia.star.android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trivia.star.android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Going Balls","description":"A road full of unexpected obstacles lies ahead in this challenging rolling ball platformer!\r\n\r\nReady for a fun ride?\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n• Easy, one-finger swipe ball control\r\n• A funny collection of balls to play with\r\n• Inventive and more treacherous tasks at every turn\r\n• Remove Ads available","descriptionHTML":"A road full of unexpected obstacles lies ahead in this challenging rolling ball platformer!<br><br>Ready for a fun ride?<br><br><br>Features:<br><br>• Easy, one-finger swipe ball control<br>• A funny collection of balls to play with<br>• Inventive and more treacherous tasks at every turn<br>• Remove Ads available","summary":"How far can you roll the ball without falling?","installs":"50,000,000+","minInstalls":50000000,"maxInstalls":63014165,"score":3.932954,"scoreText":"3.9","ratings":155874,"reviews":52890,"histogram":{"1":26832,"2":7475,"3":10755,"4":15056,"5":95753},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$0.99 - $19.99 per item","size":"179M","androidVersion":"5.0","androidVersionText":"5.0 and up","developer":"Supersonic Studios LTD","developerId":"Supersonic+Studios+LTD","developerEmail":"support@supersonic.com","developerWebsite":"https://supersonic.com/","developerAddress":"Menachem Begin 121, Tel Aviv","privacyPolicy":"https://supersonic.com/privacy/","developerInternalID":"6375726956331556115","genre":"Casual","genreId":"GAME_CASUAL","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5IsJdXtbCH6REopbRyqMOfLS3f6d1oMFfGUesEE52EP6gdYn2koQRfGEnClSygXgKw","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0-HHgpMrUcWZOTp7u1ywDHPMp9_zPCIMn6pj_d15vPSyzTw-QkYYcZ0uHgGXRE2xsxA","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/nvrPhd9HLkzxoI_x6_9S5QTxq8Qcd2MqSjCRbel421FJ1kVx-oUPj5dGuOCDqedqF6xh","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/I7t2dtmxAXr3lwJyybnbaD2F3ZVJgdK4Z8X53Zh4kqNH6-Qp0u8L-iLwk9bI5UpWeaoA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/eTf_Hszt72R3P4fYpVxsIkF8pqP_CLLAfPQ_Y9nmHUtFeQnMvYQLekIW7eodMqnHBw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/is-Z3-aF8t5W8cFYmaqBC91Obabbq9mhHez6YpIusKbueIjkdgBoMgrX7zSDKkSHCJc9","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/n3Ah8szb2CeIvH96_33NUqhkTpDH8oAWFo6ehNjKzif3Zb1BHZYpf8hNUaG9vXD_UIMs","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/aJ9tthqN494BT0907IOP2HaKzVC6nSgS9XzU-x-mbWEJZivqCKPsxjIh7Aj3hi3ipg"],"video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ySMAojHgIcI?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","videoImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0-HHgpMrUcWZOTp7u1ywDHPMp9_zPCIMn6pj_d15vPSyzTw-QkYYcZ0uHgGXRE2xsxA","contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Feb 2, 2021","updated":1628832149000,"version":"1.13","recentChanges":"Minor tweaks to ball prices and in game rewards","comments":["Fun game for awhile, despite the number of ads but the main issue that bothers me is how few tracks there actually are. Courses are constantly repeated, so by the time you've gotten so far in, you're bored of the same tracks. As for the ads (which there are a ton of, most you can skip) but you have to watch an add to get things have already seemed to earn, so that's a major disappointment. Fun, but I feel done with it, because it's all the same courses again Amazing graphics, though.","I lilke this game but i stress anytime! In level 61 its hard + 5LIVES. I also upset sometimes for always die and even the easy levels i done is repeated and shuffled. And like the epic level! I also hate ads when i on wifi so i turn it off.. Thanks also for unlimited spin but if it points to (LEVEL), i play level 2 or 1,6,and easy levels, i hate it also.. The music is nice but if i falling down, it will decrease its volume even if i jump very high the tone of the music will change.. Thank you.","Going balls could have been a good game I really enjoyed wanted to enjoy this but it just too much ads to me I can't stand it I have to uninstall it as an invasion of my personal privacy is good with a few ads but it's a Overkill not recommended","I paid to remove ads but I still get ads when refilling balls. That seems dishonest to still show ads after I have paid to remove them. It is even worse than I thought. After paying to remove the ads there are still dozens of points you have to watch ads to get thru. What a rip off.","From a marble game fan I have to say. The mechanics and physics are great with some fun challenges. The game could of been better but they littered it with ads. I pushed through to Level 102. The stages sadly repeat around stage 88 or so. Missed the ball on this one guys.

There are 2 modes, system smash and planet smash. Planet smash has a large variety of things to destroy planets with, and you can create your own planets. System smash only has a few weapons, and its like universe sandbox in a way. A few things I would like to see, are a bit more weapons in the system smash, and a bit more realistic things, like if you melt the polar ice caps the world will flood. Once that is done, this is a 5 star game","A fantastic and amazing game. Can't wait to see what other tools you guys come out with. Edit: One of the recent updates made the game not recognize my remove adverts purchase, and it doesn't allow me to make the purchase again. Hope this is fixed some point soon. Solar Smash is still great. Edit edit: Reinstalling seems to have helped. Nevermind.","This game is very good but every 3 times I reset the planet, an Ad comes up. Also, some ideas for the next update; More systems in system smash. Just the one is boring. Try adding more weapons to system smash as well. Maybe a system creator too, just like the one in planet smash. Could you name the weapons as well? Overall, I am rating this game a 4 star.","I love this game. But when i first got it, I paid for no ads. And for a while i had no ads. Now I am getting ads despite paying for no ads. For that reason I am only giving 2 stars. If this issue is fixed, i will give the last 3 stars. I dont like being scammed, even if i like the game.","It's good, but the 1 thing that really annoye me is I have tried getting the Cube World with the orange laser and the grid, but even though I make the best cube. I don't unlock it. So can you guys please fix it! I think other people around the world are suffering from it and are sad and mad.

I love playing this game in my free time, it just keeps me entertained. I really enjoy building my OWN buildings and I think it's a lot of fun. If the glitches were not there it would definitely be a 5 ☆ rating. I hope this review helped you decide on the game <3","It's finally playable again! But the only thing I absolutely HATE is that I can't change the name of my village. It freezes my game EVERY SINGLE TIME. Although about that,it's real fun and very entertaining. PLEASE fix the bug I already told you.WHAT TO ADD IN THE FUTURE:cars that actually move and get damaged, weather changes, new blocks like fabric, plant pots, flowers and plants but for FREE, flying for FREE and also tools. PLEASE ADD THESE in the game. Thank you. still 4 star rating 🌟🌟🌟🌟","I really love this game! But it does contains ads when i open my wifi but i close my wifi and it doesn't appear ads! I have like played this game for 98 hours i build my own house my own village and visit people villages its actually very fun! I really love it! I give it five stars cause it is really amazing you can call people its is really good thank you so much for making this game! May god bless you","It's a good game to play but it does get lonely when you're by yourself with only AI's just follow you and greet you. But if they productive when you're not online and help build the layout of the buildings you have placed.

Sadly it's kind of a neat app but pointless to spend any time with it because the don't offer a way to transfer the data. I have spent money buying extras and have over 1000 hours into this app and now that I've decided to upgrade my device it's all going to be thrown away.

I had to force my phone to power off. I couldn't get the game to close out. WEIRED. It will play an add for your hint, but freeze right before you get to g collect your hint. I think this is the same reason I deleted the game last time. On a positive note, it has great pics and some really nice colors.","I really do like this app. Unfortunately the ads are starting to get really intrusive. I don't so much mind having an advert before and after doing a picture (even though it sometimes does feel excessive). What I do mind, however, is having a banner advert that plays noise while doing the picture. It is UNBEARABLE. I used to listen to music while playing this app, and I just can't do that now with these adverts. It's really disappointing to have this happen to one of my favourite apps.","This app is great! I use it to fall asleep most nights. Good way to pass the time on trips, but make sure you have your phone plugged in bc this app absolutely tanks battery for some reason. There should be a way to save pictures that you want to color. A heart in the top right of the image that you can click and save to color later. Right now I've been clicking the pic and coloring a few places that way it will save to the In Progress tab and I can finish it later.","Addicted but frustrated! I love it, can't stop \"painting\" but some have some paint left over and I can't finish it! But the ones are done are beautiful. I'm totally hooked, spend hours while watching (listening!) to the tv or radio, nothing's getting done..... love it!😃 WHEN IT OPENS! see edit... EDIT so..... everything went pear-shaped and had to un/reinstall, have to pay to get rid of that annoying banner and now the thing won't launch! What is going on? Not happy 😠","The coloring is addictive! The pics are beautiful with a wide variety to choose from. The only thing I miss after the last update is the button that minimized the pic back to original size. Other than that, I love it? 8/3/2021: I still enjoy coloring in your app! You got the button that brought picture back to original size. My only complaint is the recent pictures you've added. Superheroes, mythical and less characters, new designs and I don't know but I would enjoy a different kind of picture"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.pixel.art.coloring.color.number","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixel.art.coloring.color.number&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"PUBG MOBILE 1.5: IGNITION","description":"The official PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS designed exclusively for mobile.

Updated my review after the latest update for this game: I'm changing my review cuz I truly didn't like the new interface for this game, it has become more complex, and lost its unique style, PUBG mobile used to have some special style about it different interface than most, beginners-friendly and easy to play, that's in past. On the top of that there are lots and lots of lags & crashes a lot.","This game is cool but the design of this game is too embarrasing. The main menu is amazing but the buttons, i mean the design of the style, i mean...Ugh. The style of the of the start button and other, those should be more simplier and not so much detailed cuz it looks kinda, I mean kinda childish. If its more simplier, so the design would be mature. Ok, now next point. Its said on google play store, its 16+ cuz it has high violations.

Just needs a bit more improvement...","Well to start, the topic the game revolves around is just really not something you want your kid playing ever, the looks of the game looks to be directed towards children and the bright picture will catch the eye. The graphics are really bad and it freezes every 2 minutes. There's more time for ads then there is time to play. I don't recommend this game to anyone unless your looking for a laugh.","Yes I know its a stupid game with bad graphics. I think in fact thats where it's charm comes from, Being a tasteless and toothless game. But what I don't like is the ads. After each stupid game I see an ad longer than the game I just played. At least be decent and cut the ads out. This game is almost unplayable.","It's a good game. It's fun but it just has way to many adds. Every time I complete a level an add pops up. Please fix this then I will play it more and give it a better review.","OMG...WORST GAME EVER.... DONT BOTHER DOWNLOADING UNLESS YOU WANT TO WATCH MORE ADS THAN PLAY THE GAME ITSELF. IT'S JUST AWFUL.... UNINSTALLED LESS THAN 10 MINUTES AFTER DOWNLOADING THE DAMN THING.

Would not pay a penny of real money to this game based on thecway you can play over and over and get beat every hand, higher straight, higher flush, higher two pairs. I was at a table where three players went all in and we all had a full house, but mine was the lower than the others. I love to play Texas holdem to pass time but do not see the point to just hit fold all the time. Very disappointed in this one! UNINSTALLED 4 EVER","Absolutely garbage! You only win when you absolutely need to. If you are about to lose a rank it let's you win. If you are doing good then you lose every hand. The only way to make money is by watching the adds. Also I should be able to play in any blind I want without being told I am to rich. A casino isn't gonna check your bank account before you can play a game. Ridiculous.","Sadly this game is full of cheating bots. Set to make sure you need to buy chips. It's definitely rigged to pay. And if you do pay.. you will win.. more than you probably should... kicking serious butt.. feeling like an expert player for a while.. then it wants another payday.. so not only did it switch from stacked in your favor.. to you can't win to save your life. I tested this several times with a few dollars here and there.. And with hundreds of hours. Definitely pay to win. 100%","Game was working yesterday. Today after app updated itself it won't load past initial startup screen. There's poker games that are just as good, if not better, then to waste time waiting for a fix that never should have happened in the first place. The initial add for this app insinuated it was a Strip Poker game. Sounds like false advertising to me. DELETING!!...","Fun game but definitely not fair for the free players. Way to many river catches. Seems cards favor the people who pay for the chips. Let's see how the cards will even get worse for me now... And only got worse after I put up review. They suck you in only to take all your chips you build up for free just to get you to pay money for more chips.

Most require 5-15 seconds before you can get out (30 seconds if you want a bonus-these are fine since I know what I'm choosing) of them, then tap to leave the main ad to see the secondary ad for the same app, forced to wait 5 seconds before finally tapping the X to escape it. Some ads won't even give you the option to escape in trade for losing the bonus without closing this app. Not worth my time or energy. Got other interesting apps to play without this much annoyance. Delete.","This is awful! You can't do two taps on anything without an ad coming up. And it's those 30seconds ads that you can't close. I was expecting to spend 5 minutes with an easy, relaxing logic game. Instead, I got 4.5 minutes of ads for 30 seconds of game time. Stupid!","The concept of the game is kinda cool but the ads are just too much. In the first 7 games, I watched 8 ads. Then it seemed like it was going to chill a bit, but 2 levels later and it's again, one ad per level. Then they offer you extra coins by doing guess what?! Watching an ad. Now I get you want to get paid for your ingenuity and hard work. So hit us every 5 levels with an ad. Then MAYBE I'd want to watch another ad to get more coins. As it stands, I'm about to hit ❌ DELETE.","Was really enjoying this game but then after getting to the higher levels I realized it's just like the same 10 puzzles over n over. How boring is that? I don't want to keep playing now. Why can't they figure out more puzzles instead of being lazy n just repeating the same few over n over? Also after playing for a bit of time it gets buggy and then eventually will crash. The amount of ads is so ridiculous, but I know how to get around those without having to watch them thankfully.","Very neat game. The ads I understand and tolerate. The worst ads are the ones from googleads - they won't let you back to the game after hitting the X - it just keeps going back to the googleads page and back to the ad with the X, I've had to quit the game, clear the pages, then go back to home screen to restart. GRRRR! I don't mind the ads after each level, but I've come so close to passing a 20 second challenge when googleads bumps in at 5 seconds to go. Really? That sucks!

This game is just like the Claw games, we used to have when growing up but now, you get to sit down and enjoy playing it right from your home instead of at the stores. Already have claimed a few prizes and I'm currently waiting for 3 additional plushes that have been claimed today. Can't wait to get them and play some more!","Terrible Game. Forget ever playing this with your children it will leave them in tears. They have the claws loose most of the time and even if you have it in the claws firmly it will mysteriously loosen right before it drops. It used to be good but no more, waste of money. I'm looking for another one to play.","I am so fed up. Been trying to reach support via email for 12 hours without any response. I bought coins and was charged, but never given the coins. I can't play without coins. And I am not going to buy more until this is resolved. Multiple emails with all required information and documentation and I still can not get help after 12 hours. Not going to change prior review. Why would I want to promote or trust this app? It's one bad experience after another.","This game was fun at 1st enjoyed playing with my kids at my side. We have won a few prizes and are waiting for them wich we are excited about :) I just think some of the values of the coins are not consistent. Felt ripped off a few times. Wish we could win more 60$ in coins go fast when the only games you win are for beginners and cost 1,000© and at 4,000 for 20$ come one","So i love claw machines and this game has been so fun! Ive only managed to win 2 prizes so far but will continue to save up to win more. My only concerns are lack of response from their customer service email... Im still waiting for my prizes to be shipped to me, as well as that i had one of the machines mslfunction on me which has really annoyed me as its taken me days to save up coins for this toy! Ive been trying to win it for a while now.

I see potential in this and i would definitely reccomend this to my friend.","I would definitely give this game a higher review but there is just one really bad thing about it. The ads. I understand that a company needs to make money off ads, and that's fine, but they are just so frequent, and once, I was swimming and a 10 second ad came in. By the time that the ad was over, I had drowned and I lost all of my progress. This is an awful feature so please change it. Other than that, it is a really fun and calming game. By far the best free minecraft I've ever played though.","It won't even let me play. I get into the game and only play for like 20 seconds, then it plays ads that send me AWAY from the game!! It seemed like a good game at first, a good Minecraft substitution, but the ads are just too much. Put them on the bottom of the screen or have a pop up as every so often, that would be fine, but it is literally stopping me from playing the game, so I'll never know if it was capable or not.","Okay, When I first downloaded this game I was not so sure about it. I thought it would be a cheap boring glitchy game. But, after playing it just once, I found its actually like minecraft. You are able to get skins, play in creative or survival, Play with friends, chat and have fun. It's really good and I'd reccomend to someone that cant download the real minecraft. 5 star rating definitely!!!!","This game is so much fun, I've been playing for 30 mins so far, and it is the best of the best.

Happy Color does it better. And I've noticed that when you're done with a picture and want to download it to your phone (I personally wanted to use the deer with the fruit and flower filled antlers as my lock screen), it cuts off part of the picture. I feel cheated out of the hard work I put into it when it refuses to let me see the whole picture and auto-crops. Kind of unfair.","I've been using this coloring app for almost 3 years now and I still love it, but my only issues I have now is I can't do pictures already started, off line and thats a big issue for me. Not everyone is able to have constant service or have wifi. I can do one but if I went back to do another one I have in progress, it won't let me. And my purchased pictures I feel like I should be able to do off line as well. But I still plan on using the app, just sucks I can't do anything offline anymore.","I really liked for the first hour then the ads started in full force. Suddenly theres an ad before and after every picture even if I go out of my way to avoid the must-watch-an-ad-to-unlock ones. Speaking of those more often not it acts like you never watched an ad and makes you watch another to unlock. I thought the music ones were cool until midway through plays an audio ad full blast without warning. Basically there are several ad free options out there. Its not unique enough to act this way.","Fantastic variety of beautiful pictures with more added daily. Helped with relaxation & eye/hand coordination. I always enjoyed losing myself for hours colouring but had to put it aside for other responsibilities. This app has been a great distraction while unable to get pencils & books out with young grandchild running around. I think it definitely got me through the pandemic & emotional turmoil of the past year. Thanks to all the talented artists & PBN; so glad I found you.","I love this game! It lets me choose different animal pics and other categories! I also saw some mandalas that are in my coloring books that are in this app too! I recommend it for people who want to color, but can't color in the tiny details on adult coloring books."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"paint.by.number.pixel.art.coloring.drawing.puzzle","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=paint.by.number.pixel.art.coloring.drawing.puzzle&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Pokémon GO","description":"New!

This is normally not a big deal, but over time these events have given fewer and fewer benefits. PvP rewards were cut in half in a stealth update, Stardust has become almost unobtainable outside of events, and reducing the range of pokestops and gyms was just stupid. If there's something they can capitalize on, they will, to their entire playerbases' detriment.","I've been playing on and off since 2016 and the increased distance during covid brought me back to the game because it was so much more accessible. Now, with the distance radius decreased again (when the pandemic ISNT EVEN OVER) it makes it so much less accessible for most players and those with disabilities are now less likely to be able to play. Increase the radius and KEEP IT THERE, Niantic!!!","Latest update absolutely sucks! Loading time is easily 1-5 minutes to even see pokemon show up (even with wifi on). The change to the pokestop distance is ridiculous. I played for a little in 2016 and stopped when it got lame until 2020. When I picked it back up it was awesome! They really need to look at what they're doing to their players vs their own pockets. Guess I'll be deleting it again. It's no longer fun or worth the hassle.","The new update to distance is sad. I'm upset. The change to the distance you have to be to a gym or pokestop is upsetting. Now to reach anything you have to be on top of it to even use it. A lot of these stops are in churches, parks, areas that are closed at hours some of us get to play. Even the one by my home is now terrible. Please change it back. I have kiddos that already have trouble with neurotypical people, this is an outlet for them and its gone. Too many people to be at one stop.","Have played this game intermittently since it first came out. The game has come a long way in terms of improvement, but the latest updates have seriously reduced the quality of gameplay. Distances to swipe stops and gyms has been significantly reduced. This means I spend less time catching and walking, because there is only a short zone where I can actually swipe a stop. I'm not going to walk backwards or cross a busy road just to swipe out two pokeballs.

Plenty of free boosts to get you going. Wonderful moderators who seem to really care about the game. If you do not want to spend money you do not have to but I recommend dropping 20-30 dollars out of pure respect for a job well done. Great community and a great mobile game. Highly recommended. Try server 205 or 280 to find me. Happy gaming.","A very addictive game. I love it! Its a perfect game for the genre its going for, and I can't mention how addictive it is. The only problem I have is the player settings arent obvious. You have to tap your battle score at the top and it takes you to your stats and player settings. A gear would be better, but other than that, the game is perfect. I hope pvp doesn't become an issue for me, since I am a pve player and hate conflicts with others. Perhaps more week long invincibility shields for us?","I absolutely adore this game! There are no ads, ever, and no money is required! However! You can gain a lot of awesome stuff for very little cash spent. Also, in an alliance, if an ally buys something from the cash shop, everyone in the alliance is given gifts as well (at no charge to purchaser). These can range from pretty average to very, very nice. This game has many players from around the world, and also a tap to translate feature next to messages in other languages! ANTS RULE!","So far the game is engaging and seeing the different ant types is interesting. Im still in the beginner portion of the game with about 6 hours or so of gameplay completed. End game may be completely different, but if you're used to time based resource and building mechanics, give this game a try. Gorgeous graphics combined with realistic ant types and correct identification lead this to be an engaging time.","Ok, this is actually surprisingly good. While times do start to pick up, if you focus on keeping your alliance building maxed, it can chew some of the time down. Also there are a lot of chances for things such as free diamonds and time skips. So while some stuff takes awhile. You get enough stuff to chew down on it that it isn't all that bad. Really love it, really fun."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.star.union.planetant","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.star.union.planetant&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"PK XD - Explore and Play with your Friends!","description":"Welcome to PK XD!\r\n\r\nDo you want to explore this universe and join millions of people around the world?!

I play this with my grand daughters and we have a ball together but like right now the ads are not working and this isn't the first time and there are times we can't transport to each other. There are other things they could do but I really think they have done and are continuing to do a great job. Thanks guys!!","Very nice game for children! Its definitely kid friendly. There is a chat but, it doesn't allow anyone to create their own words. You can search for words like \"Hi\"! Or, maybe \"wanna take a walk\"? Also, you can make your avatar and, make your username. It won't let you make your username inappropriate, so that's good! Great app. So many updates, ALL THE TIME!","It's almost everything it says but not everything you have to get pets separately it takes a day to get one pet so I wouldn't recommend it because you can do pretty much anything you in real life so I rate this a three star actually a four it's a really fun app I recommend it get it it's kind of like Roblox you get to build your own house but you don't need to collect surprise but you have to collect coins to unlock the house items like furniture and stuff but if you want a different house it 💰","I am playing pkxd from 2 yr . And i loved it but nowadays a very annoying issue is there. The issue is that whenever i open pkxd it loads and plays music but didn't show the screen and this is not a network issue also. I am very much irritated by this now and if the team will not solve this soon then unfortunately ,i will need to uninstall it .","The concept and the game itself is really fun. But IMHO, things are needed to fix/improve: (1) the unending mini games' bugs/glitches; (2) lacking of real social interaction with people; (3) very few places to explore; and (4) goals aren't established enough which makes it to be repetitive and boring. Also, I'm really hopeful that the houses being sold by real money come to be purchasable over time by game currencies, even if it's expensive. At least there's a chance and we'll save up for it."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.movile.playkids.pkxd","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.movile.playkids.pkxd&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Catwalk Beauty","description":"Hey beautiful, it's showtime!\r\nAll the baddies are choosing the most beautiful outfits for the catwalk!\r\nYour goal is to rock the catwalk like a queen.

They appear in the middle of a round which sucks Also, when we're given a topic, like police for example I dress as a police officer but my opponent dresses like she's going to the beach, that's not the topic but my opponent wins anyway Not fair I don't like it and just get rid of the ads it's so simple then I'd give it a 4 or something. GET RID OF THE ADS","This game is fun but how am I supposed to enjoy it when I'm being spammed with ad's around every 45 seconds. I know that ad's make the game free but there is no need for this many. the one star is for the concept of the game. I do not recommend you would just be wasting your time watching ad's.","I actually like the game, I honestly wouldn't even mind the ads if they were in between levels. But an ad pops up in the middle of the levels and it's so beyond frustrating. The levels are less then thirty seconds long, the ads are longer then the levels themselves. Honestly as much as I enjoy the game and its concept, it's not worth it.","Add hungry and boring. They make you watch 2+ adds every time you do a catwalk. It's so annoying to have to stop half way through the walk to watch an add. Also when you unlock new clothing they make you watch an add to use it. It's just a lie. Wether or not you watch the add you get the new clothing. Sadly the game is also boring. Each catwalk has obvious right and wrong options and your opponent is always stupid and will choose to wear a bikini to a wedding.","This game is really fun to play and has good graphics and good outfits but some of the outfits are kinda stereotypical, like the maid outfit has two low bunches, the white frilly head band and the dress has puffy sleeves and is black and white. I would give this 5⭐ but this game can be stereotypical.

Too many ads. $10 to get rid of them is not worth it. I'd pay $2 or $3 at most. Game gets dull once you reach the peak. The strategy is to just increase you earnings while away, open it up once or twice a day, and then get improve your stats. Which I like that there's passive income, but it's better to not even play and then just get passive money. Needs to get spiced up. Add a priestiege system, multiple start locations, and new things.","Ads are obnoxious, but playing in airplane mode stops that. It doesn't seem like the developers are still working on it because the game just cycles through the stages over and over again with zero variation. Troop spawn rate caps at 30/sec, but let's you keep upgrading it. Game is only difficult during the first time playing. The game generates money when you don't play, and the rate you gain is also upgradeable. Fun to play once in awhile, but don't forget to turn on airplane mode.","Some reviewers say this game has too many ads and is too easy. IMO, they're not playing it correctly. If you accept all of the reward multipliers and continuously upgrade, then yes... the game will be too easy and you will watch LOTS of ads. But the genius aspect to this game is that its difficulty level is TOTALLY UNDER YOUR CONTROL. Update ONLY when you can longer win. Then, update SLOWLY, and stop when you can just barely win. The game will be much more fun, and you'll watch far fewer ads.","This game is very easy to learn and can kill a little time, although there's too many ads if you have wifi on, and you can't unlock cosmetics with no wifi. Another issue is that the AI is very lazily designed and easy to beat despite it getting more upgrades than you. The AI factions always start by sending off all of their units to colonize neutral states or attack each other, leaving their starting states vulnerable to the player. Very low skill game and takes a while to get hard.","Ugh.many things wrong. First, \"no thanks\" to watching add for prize or extra gold..really does mean no thanks. But this game will force you to watch an add anyhow. Second, the adds are incredibly long. Not even worth trying to watch. Next, even in airplane mode the adds still play... don't need that extra stuff saved into my device. Then, it won't let you rate the game unless it's five stars.. have to come to playstore manually. Last, game play is too easy. Need to make AIs a bit smarter."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"io.state.fight","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.state.fight&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Parking Jam 3D","description":"Parking Jam is one of the most downloaded Puzzle Board games with more than 15,000,000 installs.\r\n\r\nParking Jam is a fun and addictive puzzle board game.

I think I've wasted time playing this game, because my current amount is $980.32 and it will not go past that. When I reached 980.32,i ended up playing maybe 6 or 7 more boards, i lost track and it's still at the same amount. Lol.","FAKE money making game. You have to get $1000 before cash out, once you get to around $700 the cash slows down so you can't get to the $1000 very quickly. To cash out for an Amazon gift card, you have to get 50,000,000 coins. I am uninstalling this game. I gave it a 1 star, but if I could, I would give it a negative 10 star at the least.","I made this piss poor company a bunch of money yesterday watching 1 of the same 3 ads every 15 seconds. This was extremely annoying but I thought if it worked it was worth it. Early this morning I had just over $700 and over 3 million in coins (you need 5 million to get a $50 Amazon card). This morning it was all gone. I was still on a higher level but at zero on everything. Don't make money for these thieves. Developers should be ashamed. Not worth 1 ⭐ and I wish there was a way to report them.","I downloaded this but after reading the reviews I see it's just like the others! You play and play, it freezes at the top dollar before you get paid and you never get paid! I dont think I'll waste my time on here to even try the game when you have a million ads before you can play to never win! Naw, I'll pass! Thanks for the reviews folks. Keep it up!","If I could give this 0 stars I absolutely would. Me, being a skeptic to player views because a lot of times it's people being too whiny about things, decided to try it myself. I read a lot about the getting stuck at 980 and getting no cash so I wanted to see. I made it to 650 before I lost patience. There is an ad literally every 15 seconds of game play, sometimes more! Oh, and don't bother hitting no thanks to double your earnings by watching an ad, they play the ad anyways.

An ad every other level, each ad approx. 1.5 minutes. Each level at the beginning takes 20-30 seconds, so for the first 20 hours, you spend more time watching ads than playing the game. Lock your phone and then unlock to keep playing? Watch an ad! Leave the app to do anything else and the come back? Watch an ad!","PLEASE TAKE OFF THE SOUND ON THE ADS. Nothing is more jarring and unappealing than playing a SILENT game only to have an AD come on BLASTING MUSIC. I don't mind the ads, but PLEASE take off the ones with sound or listen to the options players put in for no music and sound and apply that to the ads, as well. It's coming close to me just having to stop playing and get rid of the ads; I would hate to do that because I like the game.","This game goes on and off for me: 1). There's always unskippable ads when going from level to level. 2). It is quite, QUITE difficult to build up coins in this game. Unless you're cool with spending hours watching ads to build up coins, you'll be receiving a lot less than what you spend. I played through 16 levels to get a measly 25 coins. Keep in mind, the cheapest boost (or in this case hint) is 100 coins. Make that make sense.","They say this kind of game is good for BRAIN health. That might be true but it's exceptionally bad for my MENTAL health spending more time enduring ads than playing! Yes, I know I can pay instead but price is too high for such simplicity. On level 40 now but deleting - not worth the annoying ads for me. Thanks anyway. (Hint to app owner: longer intervals of play before ads might keep customers).","The ads in this game are relentless. I opted to pay to get rid of ads. The explanations regarding purchases are sadly lacking. You can pay to empty the piggy bank once it gets full, but you'll only have to pay again later. Don't bother. The game doesn't always recognize words. In the last game I played, I entered the word ROD multiple times, but it wasn't recognized. I finally resorted to using hints when I could not solve the word.

Not computers labeled player 6789. I followed these other \"players\" around. No growth or them really collecting many items. Very boring. I know that means you'll have to place ads at different times and not in the middle of play. I'm deleting the game.","Decent fun so long as you play with your data/wifi off so no ads ever appear, but there's no long-term reason to continue playing and it made my battery heat up so I'm going to uninstall. Also, surprised that a 200 hp 400 attack mega-raft will instantly die if it triggers fights with two separate one-tile 10/10 rafts at the same time.","Its an Okay game one of those mindless time consumer ones. The Huge problem is how insanely inundated it is with ads. You know instead of ads every battle you could let a guy finish the round before an ad. I believe developers are being paid by how many times they can get you in the store, downloading another. I delete something before replacing it, ((you got me here) yeah). It is an okay game if you enjoy watching ads. I'm sorry its time 4 me 2 find another one minus at least 80% of ADS","Everything you want from that ad you see when you play other games of the islands attacking other islands except this isn't multiplayer or at least it really doesn't feel like it there's a lot of ads so unless you pay for removal if you're not going to enjoy it really sad because this is the kind of game you want to see because it's the kind of game that would be fun just to play for hours because it's mindlessly fun","Great start to this, meaning I see potential.

There are a reasonable amount of ads, unlike most 3D games from big companies. I also like how the bots you play against aren't unreasonably stupid like other games with challenge bots coded in, unless they aren't bots...? I do wish that you could buy more skins and trails using the currency rather than having to watch ads though.","Way to many ads. After every single level it asks if you want to watch or lose it. If you press lose it, it will still bring you to another ad regardless if you say no. So irritating.","too many adds and the levels are too short. longer more diverse levels and and you can keep the advert after each one. one or the other needs to be addressed.","Well made, but it's just not fun. In between every level theres 2 chances to watch an ad for extra rewards and even when you say no you get an ad anyway. The levels are so short and easy you'll literally spend more time trying to dodge ads than actually playing the game, and the game isn't fun enough to be worth it. And I get you can turn airplane mode on but that doesnt make it more fun, it just takes less time to realize how unfun it is.","I've earned the unicorn and the Harley Quinn skins through progression but it won't allow me to claim them!

THAT leads me to the last most egregious point...WHY CAN'T WE JUST LEAVE THE SCREEN? WHAT IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY? FIX THAT!!!","Enjoyed it very much at the start, and they \"hook\" you by making the game pretty easy but as you progress through the levels they make it practically impossible to win without buying extra boosters etc. Also you don't have the option of watching an advert instead so if you want to advance you have to purchase booster packs. I love the imagery and graphics however.","I was pretty addicted to this game for a while, but the difficulty curve ramps way too hard- it reaches a point where you have to use power ups to beat levels (which of course are content you can pay for) but even with power ups the levels can often feel exceedingly difficult. I'd recommend finding a way to make all levels beatable, but add a star rating or something for those that want to go above and beyond.","This game will become a pathetic waste of time if you don't spend a ton of money after the first \"Makeover.\" Next, get you very close to winning in the higher levels, but It's strategically impossible to finish a puzzle w/o, once again, money. I am a software engineer and know exactly how these algorithms work. Run away and run fast. These developers are selfish. Over all, I'm disgusted.","Wish I had read the reviews they were all spot on! It gets too difficult to play little puzzles you need to actually do any makeovers. I already have two of the candy crush games either be a design game or be a match up game.

I don't want that I want the old simple way without all the bells and will whistles you might say. I'm going to uninstall them and find another one to play. What a shame because I liked playing the original one I've been using for years now they want to go flashing.","The old version was working well but they pretty much forced us to down load this version. Don't like it so I am uninstalling it. Too many ads and I want the old version back.","Ad simulator.... its solitaire not some big fancy casino game. To play 1 game you have to watch 2 ads with one of them flashing at the bottom. It's only solitaire get one of the old versions. Nothing new here other than greed.","I really enjoy this game not to hard to get some coins and points, cause everytime you stack all the cards the points is given from each card. If you seems to forget that you still more moves the cards is giving you the hint. Because of that it would be so easy to finish. And magic will help to give you the cards you need that is hidden. If you like a simple Solitaire I recommend this one to play. Thanks for this game.","It looked nice at the beginning, just to realize you are bombarded by ads before and after each game. Up to 6 ads for each game. Plus some ads freeze the game.

Good for those like me who can skip the stuff we don't enjoy as much and get to the challenge as well as suiting those who like community and social experiences. The ad for wordsearch app comes up when get a chance to win an extra move. It won't let you progress. The only option is to install and play that game. Killing the fun people","LOVE THIS GAME!!! I play garden and homescape which are very similar but since downloading and playing this I honestly haven't been back into the others at all. If you are patient with completing some of the levels then you won't have to spend any real money but if you do it won't break the bank. Worth playing you won't be disappointed 💯👍..... Just an update after playing this game now for a while, I STILL LOVE THIS GAME !!! you will too so don't scroll past this download it. 6 stars 🌟","Truly a good game. Exercise for the mind. Good stuff! Try it, I have been playing every day for a year or more. I am now playing on a team, my only complaint is that the ads for mind puzzle games do not have a star in the corner to get back to playing. I won't try to get more moves that way. I have to reboot to get back to the game.","Before you download this entertaining match 3 game, be aware that it can be pretty frustrating. Obviously, the difficulty level will increase as you climb through the levels. But it becomes a real pain when you're blowing through your lives and collected rewards just to hit a metaphorical brick wall. However, if you really enjoy never-ending challenging games and have plenty of time and money to burn, I recommend Matchington Mansion.","This game is so entertaining, it has easily and consistently been able to keep me coming back at least 4 times per day, 5 days per week (honestly, it's rare for a day to pass without me playing). The levels steadily increase in difficulty, however, there hasn't been a level difficult to the point of giving up because of the frustration of inability to pass. The storyline is interestingly intricate in it's development and depth, yet easy to follow or play without having to know it.

Most of the advertisements pop up after every puzzle and they are about 15 seconds or longer and the X in the corner is very small so typically when you go to click the ex, it takes you to the app store. But the game itself is very nice. The graphics are good and the puzzles are fun. You can rotate the puzzle to see the words better which is nice. I would recommend but chill out on the advertisements... (they ask for money to fix ads)","First few levels are fun. Once you get past level 10, the ads take longer than the levels do. There is literally a 30 second ad before each new level. And then after the 30 second ad, you have to wait for the screen to clear which is another 10 to 15 seconds. Uninstalled after just 1 day.","Had to reinstall after getting a new phone. Now, I can't play in the tournament. There is no access button. Have contacted support several times. The only thing they tell me is that tournaments start at 5 pm on Friday (I know) and that you must be on at least level 65. I'm on level 82. I wish support would get this fixed UPDATE: I have contacted the in app support and still no fix. You ruined a good game","Good game. Lots of fun levels. But there's an ad after each level which is really annoying if you finish the levels quickly and then have to watch an ad each time. Wish good games didnt have so many ads. Maybe an ad like every 5 or 10 minutes? But after every level is just too much. Just buy a big word search book. Will cost you less than paying for a game and no ads after you finish a page.","I liked this game. But the f- mystery word in a lot of levels makes it complicated.

Some ads never give you an option to close it out, and I have to close the entire app. My last ad complaint is that they want you to turn the volume up to listen to the Buddy. However all their ads have the volume set at double the level which is incredibly annoying. Simply said, they just have major advertisement issues with this free game. I'm being generous with two stars","Absolutely would give this game 5 stars if it wasn't for these 2 reasons: 1. The amount of ads. Everytime you kill buddy you get an ad which is meant to be a choice ad, but forces you to watch it. 2. It's meant to be an offline game but you can't even buy stuff from the shop with bucks if you don't have internet. Fix these 2 things and I'll play it all day and night.","If you can put up with immediate ads then you might like this game. I recommend it. But this is only a 4 star as goggle games can't connect to the game... Every time I go on it says failed to connect please try again. And I do but I says it again and again. This means for me that I can't restore progress and other utilities. Please fix this and thanks for listening.","I love your game. But there are 3 things you need to know about your game: 1 is the lag it takes forever to load, idk if that's my tablet or your game. My device isn't laggy when I'm not on the app so I think it's the app. 2 is the ads. There are ads like every 10 seconds and it just gets on my nerves. And yes, I know what the ads are for. But your game has a little too many ads in it. And 3, I think there are a little much things that cost $$$. Please fix these and I will rate the game 5 stars.","I love this game! Its really funny and entiertaning! Also, very stress reliving, and a great time passer when I'm board the only thing is that sometimes, the game will freeze and kick me out when I'm either trying to play the game and enjoy it, or when I'm watching ads to get new free wepons, and too many ads, but other than that, the game is amazing!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.playgendary.kickthebuddy","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playgendary.kickthebuddy&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Slice It All!","description":"Tap to flip the knife and slice amazing obstacles in juiciest way!\r\nCut or slice everything and become slice master!","descriptionHTML":"Tap to flip the knife and slice amazing obstacles in juiciest way!<br>Cut or slice everything and become slice master!","summary":"Tap to slice!","installs":"10,000,000+","minInstalls":10000000,"maxInstalls":14112016,"score":3.7882352,"scoreText":"3.8","ratings":43462,"reviews":16592,"histogram":{"1":8466,"2":2379,"3":3402,"4":4857,"5":24356},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$2.99 per item","size":"63M","androidVersion":"4.4","androidVersionText":"4.4 and up","developer":"VOODOO","developerId":"VOODOO","developerEmail":"support@voodoo.io","developerWebsite":"https://www.voodoo.io/","developerAddress":"4 rue Jules Lefebvre, 75009 Paris","developerInternalID":"8306041507631589049","genre":"Action","genreId":"GAME_ACTION","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/UXBR3KEHzFoJ0XYyw6XAitWKo5Jy2j7JLSKccMEboIA-HTvC0ggTOL2hw_-MWgZ5L_w","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/hN2USZFtsH1KROD3ApturGLOMkWrwUFIaic0oaEpQuWBfomEdDlEg70jIp-oA07Lsw","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1drQv2YIYTDN76cOSzWDbhzDvzh7bbW12PO1ofYKjyCjygW-Ymgp-DcSMfHx1uBGkww","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/RQ7P9XLGB-MHKrhM9c3wyXCes_c8mDCDGo57wkgrNWFkhbD-wBaAkkckKN_-p4ZhJ_Y","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/yRq6VZ-bZPpzSfHagHFmEU_1rBbw-hXlCeMP0nWH1EO2tQhs55XbzYfsFH3JnOwyrA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/izwGH-6q9eI0H6Su5Hn1ofEqVSLEbzI1di8s_XMyhG6CG3LAAo9I4Fu2gvj9lxbjdHc","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/4n8XrA1D95nm0R3FMZD9VhNJfYf_o4AndZ3j1Ov7eCz48tBt8bpmvCQIPpo2-yM3ggE","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/QEZ4ZEKmdHV70fsZH63MT96jVYVE9YZxSXwoB79ObbwrXLXMXOUjR2ZGmDlIn3vOuoE","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/sGHyWa0JA5I5lYyJYIeZJjTF11YVmmBhDHBex4kkgrx_RH7iQPfGoVaaiJ97uWoWems","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/vaCOF38ZNI29bgJAT7l2Yj3O6edg8hp6cL8LmDo9nhH-XHpp4-a3AEmhpvrbCuc8gSU","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/j_iTmpkf8uWf74-_gQEZdLQP5bha4qtDsq6pomvoAOV9Os0tVLyA-Qx7k0ZdD30_fg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9iNNU1wEaJ5GT7Eqzh6k4PFhUZDSgDy72bJJ6NNVYdlhxcGGDZMiZTb4hmV_vNo1ZA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/nynwwvb0H1d4dlm4xBvqHEAuOfB3_UYk3R9_iB2uYPvKXSPyghpFR_R8HM2aNMzSk3Y","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/RfDkzNjERKAMgeLYCc3BqhfU0rNYbel9tnnnZdkuvn3NXBZ4uU2CZnXdJugikh4MaJE","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ytb2wwR9SGDIZ_43_BYpn-ZIotlVNhMLB1aoYD-dk7-HLnNYPnOpc5I5I46f9Ad3rQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/eJVqRdQAK9bZOF1i_1IGqW0iyuNWPzgeyFW3PrCfqHbia8jUf5qX6---h6k6rlPtkKU","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ebF9GDAd9E7lzuTtUQf6OHM3gOvc5PkNFStIGh7-h2QhpRmX3PumtTH6OzLpCG7NYQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/gJNn3DEKWm_We3jqF0Pq4Us6Zzb_Q1d00V4b8zAJn_jY045A1xjvbRx2Lm1E2u0Q0bg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/S7hy4aiQ82eGdxGE1Cd1lQy9BIlMrICbYvixqGqBW9IfscTQ9OobmIu_cLxDRECfPmRK","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/R0rhRx_Llhvc8d5gXSwFNoFDgUQ5-21z4NJcC2wIEd_iVs6CCkeK_oZuZZSj4-MWw8AQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/EP0c8GY4tAqrDNdCY9mFpqAzI7B5HbdZ6gYhS51k0gotJ_kSEkGsl7c5Hi2nb640FeU","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/VqZR3kZWG0LQqMKjl51JTgcgNV9vrVDUDwwjgcc8YCvApHmpMfBEzs4E_aFbnt2qJnwT","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Tz2ypmrRBSLnIGxzy0V_6KQjY-czSs9mffdixVKOxidRVQ4draZqFtPMT73Id_umDj8I","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/gBpUyPlQyF6jKXFcV-s_6MBmmkmzgZDfO9CdIss7Jq67mnx_EliJm1TWg05Vlzqi79E"],"video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B5mdpVFA0-w?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","videoImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/hN2USZFtsH1KROD3ApturGLOMkWrwUFIaic0oaEpQuWBfomEdDlEg70jIp-oA07Lsw","contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":false,"released":"Mar 3, 2021","updated":1626941361000,"version":"2.0.2","recentChanges":"Bug fixes","comments":["Its a fun time killer but a lot of issues.

So after the new update everytime that you go back into the app you have to agree that you are over sixteen (witch is stupid because there is nothing inappropriate or anything like that) and other stuff. At least the knife thing is fixed. It was a five stars and now it's two","I used to really love playing this game, it was very relaxing and enjoyable. But, it has begun to annoy me which is why my original 5 stars have turned to 2 stars: the new update has caused the game to not work without WiFi meaning you can't enjoy the relaxing side to the game without ads popping up every 10 seconds, the games seem to be so much shorter than they were before and the wheel at the end doesn't give you a chance to get x50, it's just by luck! Super dissapointed by the changes made!","Nice to kill time but the ads are constant and actually freeze the game and cause you to fail at times. Edit: Added a star because there have been updates made. The mechanics and points system still need a lot of work, but there is potential. As a suggestion, make some kind of combo system, and make some objects more points than others.","The game was great however, it doesn't let me play offline to get away from the annoying ads, pls. reduce the ads, because sometimes they won't load and loose my progress of playing a level. Also pls. add something more new since they're repetitive. I don't want to delete it but it doesn't feel playable anymore."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.tummygames.sliceit","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tummygames.sliceit&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Jigsaw Puzzles - Puzzle Games","description":"Get an engaging jigsaw puzzle experience with one of the world’s most-downloaded puzzle games from a top developer!

We always received as gifts so this brings back a lot of memories. Beautiful pictures and wide assortment. Unfortunately my phone gets noticeably hot when playing. Phone temp returns to normal soon after ending play. I've also experienced pieces getting \"lost\" and the only way to \"find\" them is by using the hint button or starting over from the beginning. No big deal just unsure if these annoyances can be fixed.","The puzzle pics are are nice and the UI is easy to use. BUT.. there are some MAJOR issues with the app.. if you for any reason need to leave a puzzle unsolved or the app freezes (which happens at least twenty times a day), the app cannot continue the pics in progress. It shows the percentage, but all pieces are in place and only way to try to solve the pic is to remove all pieces and start from scratch. There should be an update coming to make the app more stable. Maybe a way to store the pics in progress offline and continue them. Or linking to a social media account to save the information.","There are lots of bright & colorful puzzles to choose from. You can also chose the number of pieces you want your puzzle to have. From as little as 24 PCs to over 200+ PCs. Depending on your age &/or preference. I also liked the fact that the puzzle itself was dividend up into four sections, automatically. Each section is done separately. The puzzle pieces are easy to scroll through and chose from. I liked the way the pieces \"clicked\" when properly placed together. Super fun!","I used to love this puzzle game until they started the word connect ads!! I don't mind ads, I realize that is how we can play for free. But WORD CONNECT POS ad doesn't let you back into the game unless you download the word connect game. For the live of all that is holy just get rid of that one ad!! All the rest are fine.","It's frustrating and disappointing that I can't place pieces in little groups around the puzzle when sorting by color or by picture object. I end up with a mess of pieces on top of what I'm working on. Otherwise this is great. I've been doing the 144 piece ones so I don't have to zoom and scroll.

The game does lag a lot(like many mobile games), and when it does, I usually miss something, such as a heel or a diamond. 2. Some levels don't even have enough heels to even finish the level, maybe check on that. Overall, it's a pretty good game to play when bored, and although there are ads after every level, they don't play in the middle of the level, like SOME games do. Took away two stars for the problems I have.","DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME game glitches and you lose ALL THE TIME takes to long to load and you spend more time waiting for it so you can play than you actually do playing! It doesn't have a negative rating or I'd give it a negative number!","Everytime when you join the game after a day it just freezes my screen but I can hear the music and everytime when I tap the screen when it froze I always die and then when I press Retry it freezes and there are way too many ads that make my phone crash! I am never playing this game EVER!! Just great, its becomes reslly laggy and most of the times it freezes or you can\"t move, just great -_-","Watched more ads than actually played the game!! Watched an ad to get 3 more gold keys to open the chest/box and I don't get them, watched another ad to get what I'm owed, still no gold keys, thinking I'm going to play the game then I have to watch another ad now to claim diamonds when I don't want any, then another diamond ad straight after the last one before I can play the game finally!!!! 4 ads one after the other at 30s per ad, sorry but uninstalling it now.","Only download this if you really want to. Don't highly recommend, just recommend a little. Creators, maybe as the levels gone on, make them more challenging. Even on level 53, it is really really easy and I like apps that get more challenging as the levels go. An example of 'one of these apps' and be Line colour (what I think it is called).

When the aliens are in the ski lodge setting, the graphics go crazy. The trees and hills block the view of the lodges. U can not see anything to shoot at but bullets are hitting the hero out of no where. Otherwise I love the game. Please keep the aliens out of ski lodges.","It starts out okay but as you play the enemy shots faster than you can. Weapons are stupid, seriously, a lever action rifle when you need a high speed gattling gun? The other problem is it switches to 3D view, which slows everything down and ruins your aim. By the time it switches back to shoot mode, you're dead. Dump the 3D, its a waste. The only way around this problem is to buy shields at 2.99 for 30, which you will burn through quickly. Clearly, this is money pit. Game over for me.","Uninstalled after playing for 1 min, ridiculous amount of ads, the game play lasted less than 10 seconds, I am forced to watch already two ads before I was even returned to the score page. I realized that the game is just a pure ads bait, designed to force you through as many ads as possible before you uninstall, the developer probably already knows that uninstall is inevitable for anyone who downloaded this game, so might as well force as many ads as possible before the inevitable uninstall.","It's not a bad game to play it's just that you always stuck shooting all these bandits in the house I want to shoot some of those green guys and the girl jumping off of the building and grasping on to the helicopter that's more exciting you guys think you can make a game just like that instead of being stuck on shooting these bandits in the houses🤔","So far it's pretty fun. The music is worth it alone. There are ads that I've seen but the music makes the wait not so hard. Just started playing, I'll update if I find anything. DEVELOPERS. LOVE THE MUSIC GUYS.

The art is cute, vibrant colors, but my biggest problem is the fraudulent ads for this game. If they showed the real game play it would be a 4* game. And if they actually made the game in the ads, it would have been a 5*+ game. Right now, it's just a lie.","this game is great. love the graphics and the color combinations. so lively and colourful! the only thing i wished the game allowed was the option to gain extra moves by watching ads as an initial one-time chance per game, instead of 900+ coins right off the bat. but other than that, i'm enjoying it! also, i liked the one-on-one chat support for issues built right in the game. i had the opportunity to use that function today and they responded promptly. kudos to the devs for this game! 👍","I was enjoying this game until I hit the 150 levels. Those levels are unwinnable. I have played level 157 so many times that I couldn't even begin to count. I don't have any in game money left so I can't add 5 more turns to the level. Not that 5 more turns would help anyway. And I refuse to spend real money to help me get through these levels. When you read all the other reviews telling you that you cannot win the levels, believe them! This game is no longer fun. I am going to delete it.","Royal Match is great choice if you like matching games.You can join a team and get lives from your team mates which comes in handy when you're on one of the many hard levels. I would have given the game a 5 star rating but the one that thing that really irks me is you have to work really hard to overcome the aforementioned hard levels and your reward is a pittance, like between 35 and 50 coins compared to what you have to spend, 900 coins or more to get an additional 5 lives.","Game is good. When you reach levels higher than 500 the levels become impossible without power ups and then you must use everything to get past it. Used at least 75 lives, used every power up, now I have none. I am not paying for extra anything. This became frustrating so I have uninstalled the game.

I gave the app a 3 star raiting because of the ads.there is like and ad after you win and sometimes you get an ad while your playing its rare though. If you could make there less ads i would probablyget this game again. BUT YOU HAVE TO LOSE SOME OF THE ADS","Yes, I love this game, yes it's a blast, yes it has lots of ads, but I don't even mind that!!! What I do mind is the fact that once the ad is over, it doesn't take me back to the game!!! I have to close the game and reopen it, then if I got through the level it shows that I didn't and I have to do it again!! It's very upsetting, and that's the only reason for the four stars and not five!! Sorry guys!! I love the game though, and I'm keeping it!?!💋💋💋💖💖❤️❤️👍👍💖💖😁😁","Dont even try to tell me \"you can buy ad free\" or \"give us 5 stars if u like us\" its not gonna work :/ this game has way too many ads, i recomend adding optional ads, or adding LESS ADS. There are WAY too many. No one will like this game if u do this its no fun and annoying!🤒😖","Hey, I saw some inprovement in the ads today! Some of the levels are a bit easy but I don't blame the creators, you can't make a hard puzzle everyday. Great game!","The is quite soo easy game to play!!

This was a very relaxing game for me but now its just frustrating, and not to mention you can't enjoy any event becuz you'll be stuck on a level, thus, unable to complete the goals. And if you were to watch the gameplay of any levels, you would notice that the number of moves of each level has been significantly cut down. What for? Disappointing!","I used to quite enjoy wasting time (and de-stressing) playing this game but they have completely wrecked it by reducing the number of moves in the hard stages (e.g. used to be 24, now 13) that makes them almost impossible to achieve as you have to wait for that lucky game when all the stars align and you get out. No skill. I've been stuck on one level for almost a week now and have given up. Any recommendations on a replacement de-stresser would be appreciated (and I was SO close to level 5000).","I love this game. Let me rephrase, I USED TO love this game! Lately it seems like every other level is a \"Super Hard\" level & I end up stuck for a week or more to finally have to spend money to get unstuck only to be stuck again 3 or 4 levels later. 🤯 I have spent much more than I care to admit playing this game I am done if something doesn't change quickly. I am taking a break when Dance Season is finished bc I bought the Golden Ticket. Which is useless since I can't pass levels! Disappointed","Super addictive, but Evil rotten greedy game, literally impossible to advance without spending money. They have cut the number of moves you have to work with by HALF recently so you don't stand a chance (Youtube videos from 6 months ago prove it). Also, I don't care about cleaning up the house and all the animations of it, stupid pointless annoying waste of time. Frustrating. I understand games needing to make money, but it shouldn't be required to pass a level.","#Changedmy5starsto3 Love this game but over time it has become a bit frustrating. Pieces moving in the opposite direction of which you swipe. It happens constantly and usually as you're about win or make a major play. 🤔Levels have gotten way too difficult. Nothing wrong with a challenge but let's not forget this is still supposed to be fun!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.playrix.homescapes","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playrix.homescapes&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Family Farm Adventure","description":"Family Farm Adventure is an exciting game of exploration and farming! \r\n\r\nPack your bags and roll up your sleeves.

","comments":["I've been playing this for a couple months and really like the game. But I've also seen how quite quickly the developers have gotten greedy making energy tougher to get and things use more energy so you need to buy items. Extra materials needed are very rare. The ads in the game work sporadically so extras that way are also rare. Per the forums on Facebook, I'm not the only one that feels this way. I'm going to delete this one.","I like the game. But u should of listened to the reviews before downloading it. U am lv. 14 now. The biggest issue is the energy. I log on with full energy and collect the energy in my farm get a total of 103 energy. It is about 5 minutes of play time that is silly. I am not happy with that. The cost of clearing is completely ridiculous. I can't imagine what it's like at higher levels. I understand why it this way, is so we spend the money we work our butts of for. I am considering on leaving.","I enjoy the game play and the story line, but it takes forever to build up enough energy to complete anything. Yes, there lots of ways to get energy, but you don't get enough when it costs too much energy to clear things. And I can leave my game all night and barely build up any energy because of the energy limit. Also, they want you to buy every little thing and it doesn't last long, or too hard to complete things to earn rewards I paid for because not enough energy.","Storyline, graphics, and gameplay are great. However, I don't think I have ever seen a game pushing so many microtransactions and ad-viewing in my face. They aren't even good deals (if they were, I'd actually be tempted). You can't spend hours at a tube because your energy depletes, but I don't mind checking in a few times a day.","I love this game, BUT some items take over an hour to make and are needed for ALOT of the orders, therefore, you are stuck or forced to pay alot. I have paid some. Developers, can't you modify the game some to keep us playing? I don't want to lose interest but this is the point of games I usually find myself leaving games because it take sooo long to progress. I am certain others feel the same. Consider the player/payers. Otherwise, great game so far.

The game is fine, the lil stickers are cute, the game is fairly easy and a good game to download if you're just looking to waste some time. The main drawback is there are too many ads to enjoy the app as a way to de-stress; but hey, I get it, we're all out here tryin to make money so its whatever.","The game itself is pretty decent. It's not super hard, but enough to get your brain to work a bit. The problem is there are so many ads making it so you finish one maybe two stickers then get an ad. Theres an ad every 20-30 seconds of playtime. Many of the ads are hard to skip or have disappearing skip and x buttons. I understand apps gotta make money somehow but this makes the app basically unplayable without purchasing the ad free version.","i don't see any ads in this game.(because i changed to \"director mode\" from settings.)but reason,why i rated this 3 stars bc... i downloaded this game from youtube ad,and in that ad,while folding the paper,it made sounds like. SMOOTH LIKE BUTTER CUP CRIMINAL UNDERCOVER.(XDDDDDD) AND IN REALITY IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SOUNDS!!! RECOMEND BUT NOT RECOMEND XDDD.THANKS FOR ATTENTION.LOVE YOU!","Good game and it's good for like you know, for example, like say you were playing some sort of hard game and your angry, simply just go off your screen and go on paper fold. furthermore, download now great game easy but challenging at the same time.

During the day every single game I join I can play for around 30 seconds and the game freezes up. I reboot cod rejoin the game and freezes up again. Garbage. I'm pretty sure these issues are mostly on Android phones. Everyone I know that plays this game has an iPhone and they have no issues","This is my third time writing a review for this game and this time it'll be good. I love what y'all did with the meta it just seems balanced, but I do still hate the fact that most crates are a gamble and how the spins are also a huge gamble. In my opinion how they do things with items in Cold War and Warzone is probably a decently better thing. I'm not saying make everything $20 but just make things a bundle. I also know that there is bundles, other then that this game is pretty good.","It's not good for free player . I am playing this game from February 2020 , I have played approx 7k BR matches . The worst part of game is Lucky draws and CP . There is no other way to earn CP , we have to purchase it and I am a student , how can I get money . I also want some good things not all but atleast one . I have spend some money on lucky draws but didn't get any good thing . Sorry CODM I Love you but you don't love me 🥺😢.","I absolutely love this game but when I'm downloading the skins and maps and even inviting people to join my team it just licks me out of the app. It's gets really old real quick and I don't have the patience to deal with it most of the time, please fix this, I know it's not my connection because it's loading up fine but I can't really do anything on the game whatsoever. But overall a great game if it weren't for that.","This current release August 2021 has issues. The play is no longer smooth since I downloaded it. Especially during BR , it breaks movement for a second or two. It happens randomly. Fix it please I'm editing this again, how can a game go from good to fair to bad in one update. The lag is now ridiculous, the same network, the same phone but this version is leagues behind the previous in terms of smooth game play It is a big problem.

Riddled with bugs leading to lost progress all the time, and recently hit several times by hackers. I've been locked out of my account for close to 10 days now, separately events progress was lost. Right now it's really not worth your time and effort. Very disappointed, submitted feedback via the app and on Facebook multiple times in the past, was always ignored. ---- They fixed my account after much complaining. Game got more stable lately. 1 to 3 stars.","Love the game, but for some reason, the latest update(34.9) is not available in my playstore. I can't do pvp without it. I have tried all the obvious fixes. I emailed the developers, they responded and said it's fixed. It's not, nothing changed. I assume they're done, and so am I. Uninstalled. 8/13- reinstalled, still no updates available. As much as I like the game, I may soon have to change my rating. It seems as though customer support has given up.","Gameplay is OK. But might get boring in a few days (maybe i have overgrown such games). Too much cluttered. Too many buttons on the home screen and any other screen. Whatever u want, there is an ad for it and multiple ads. And u can just earn all the currency by watching all the ads. No need to even play the game (pun intended). i actually enjoyed playing this game as 'Instant Play' for more than a year. This was my default 'Go To' game to pass some time. It did not have so many buttons and options. once i installed it, i unistalled it in a week. It would have been better if the interface was not so cluttered with so many buttons / gifts. Maybe the developer could move the buttons away from the home screen into some other 'Single Button'","The controls are finicky, and if for any reason you lose the save data, either by factory reset or you get a new device, any purchases and/or progress is permanently lost. Doesn't matter if you signed into google play games. Doesn't matter if you diligently hit that save button at the end of each session. When you download the app and sign in again you will have nothing. Support does nothing to help either. Update: 3 years later and the ability to restore progress is still nonexistent.","You gotta take the good with the bad. The game will lag. You loose the game AND your coins and crystals and NEVER compensated. The game has bosses you cannot beat.

I've been playing it for a while, and it has remained extremely challenging - but not impossible. Other matching games eventually become so easy that I lose interest. Or they become so difficult that it's impossible to successfully complete them, and that is no fun either! None of this happened with Tile Master 3D. HOWEVER, after completing about 550 levels, I had to stop playing, much to my dismay. The screen freezes up, or goes completely black, making it impossible to play.","The game is really really fun, I enjoy playing. I would give it 5 stars but it is very frustrating that they stop in the middle of a game for an add. Not sure how long my patience will withstand interruptions of my focus. Up date...this game keeps messing up and rotating during the game, Can't play when rotated it's way to small to play. I love to play this game but will have to take it off and hope they will update it.

Problematic, but that isn't the biggest problem. The problem is the message here. We must wear trendy clothes, have TikTok, and go on extreme diets... really? At the end of each level there's a boy waiting for you. Basically, you're making all these choices to get a boyfriend. Sexist much? Not to mention the amount of bullying you can get away with if you're popular and pretty. Don't follow this game. You don't need the boy and you don't have to be a queen bee.","This is just an opinion game, and the game chooses on it's opinion! So annoying! Not a good example for kids. In the ad, it had books and a golden cake. It said to choose the cake. Not true! Reading is healthy for your brain. Cake is junk food and could give cavities. Plus, there is probably a boy out there who likes girls who like to read. A life lesson is in this review. It doesn't matter what your girlfriend likes for you to marry her. It matters that she's nice to you.","This is a awful game in general and I would be glad to explain why. First off the gameplay sucks and second its showing kids that if you become vegan you'll be popular or wear a revealing outfit youll be popular or you can't read books you should only do makeup instead you won't be polar or you'll lose friends. NOT HOW LIFE WORKS. I get it it's a game but come on you can do better than that. Instead it should show that everyone is perfect the way they are. By the way I'm a kid saying this.","Okay, I decided to check it out just for fun and the gameplay kind of sucks. Same thing over and over. As for the moral of the game that everyone hates so much, I don't think thats the issue with the game. The game isn't saying that you should do such drastic things for popularity. I feel like most people who play the game have a good understanding that you shouldn't do the things shown. For me though, the gameplay is what made me give 3 stars. Too many ads. Low quality. Repetitive.","You may be wondering why i gave this game only one star. Well this game is called queen bee wich just sounds like a terrible game. I will say that from experience i have gone through many fases where I think I need style-ish clothes and perfect teeth and just to be perfect to fit in. In this game you litterly have to be perfect by choosing the choice with the green thumbs up and if you dont you dont get the boy at the end of the game and you dont get the possey to be even more popular.

Keep your mind active with Blockudoku®!","comments":["I installed a game, not an advert, The overall concept really isn't bad, it's a puzzle game which acts kind of like Tetris. Unlucky for you, the game is almost impossible to play due to the amount of disturbance caused by ads at the start and end of levels. These ads are usually are skippable after 5 seconds, but are so frequent that your play time will be watching advertisement rather than gameplay.","Ads are very frequent. I get it's free, but there's reasonable and then there's ridiculous. I wish all these ads in games were muted, because no one needs to know what I'm doing on my phone. The ad for this game that got me here was the unique shapes, however there is no cat, just a grid. I'm getting really tired of the bait and switch nature of game ads. Not being able to rotate pieces is annoying.","Too many ads and they are extremely loud even after turning off sounds in the game menu. They also pause whatever music/podcast/etc you are listening to to play their own sound. This happens before and after every game you play. The game also cheats and gives you bad pieces sometimes to force you to watch more ads. Decent idea for a game but just has too many hoops to jump through to actually play.","Wow ... because of the ads at bottom of screen u r NOT able to see the shapes u need to place. Then when u raise shape to c it then try and put it back to raise next shape that 1st one places on board but that's not where u wanted it to go. Hey game folk fix that, I should be able to c shapes without having to touch them.","I was playing headball 2 and ur add popped up! And it doesn't close unless I play the mini game! Why the heck should I be forced to play the mini game! I haven't even played this game! You get this one star just because of your annoying add! And also the name of your app is really depressing! So if I could give you a -5 I would! Anywhich way, please make your adds closable without playing the mini game in order to remove this bad review from your app"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.easybrain.block.puzzle.games","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easybrain.block.puzzle.games&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Geometry Dash Lite","description":"Jump and fly your way through danger in this rhythm-based action platformer!\r\n\r\nPrepare for a near impossible challenge in the world of Geometry Dash.

Love every level (except Can't Let Go) and the music is oh so good (especially Cycles). The only problem is that it's easy to rage and get broken screens , broken phones, etc. Also, it would be nice if the music could be downloaded in the game rather than from New grounds. If this all doesn't make sense, then just play the game. You'll love every part of it.","I think this is the best geometry dash except for the one u have to pay for. I've beat every level three coins except for clutterfunk which is only 100% The levels are great and the songs are awesome. I only have one problem. Sometimes the songs aren't rythmitic and timed with the jumps. The songs play faster than they should. I've tried it on 3 different devices and the problem stays so I don't think the problem is with my iPad. I would be glad if it was fixed but anyway 5 star.","It is unfortunate that not all the RobTop levels are available, and also disappointing that you cant even go in the level editor at all. However, I understand why you cant do these things, as it is not the full version. It includes enough content for me to still enjoy playing it, but it is a tiny bit disappointing still.","This game is Amazing! I've always wanted to play the full game of Geometry dash but after I installed this game I never even needed the full version! For a free version of the actual game, I'd say it works brilliantly. For the positives, It has great quality and amazing content! It also makes you feel like your playing the actual game! For the Negatives all I would really say is can you please settle down the ads. Other that that it's a brilliant game. I highly recommend it. 😄👍","The levels are hard, but that is the best thing about it! I put 4 stars because the ads are driving me crazy! I know you think you can turn your wi-fi off but some ads get downloaded with the game. On the plus side though, you get to choose the shape of your icon and even choose the colours😉"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.robtopx.geometryjumplite","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.robtopx.geometryjumplite&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Goyok","description":"Goyok is a jigsaw puzzle with the theme of movie and TV series cover pictures.\r\nChoose the movie or tv series cover you love.\r\n3 mode you can choose now.","descriptionHTML":"Goyok is a jigsaw puzzle with the theme of movie and TV series cover pictures.<br>Choose the movie or tv series cover you love.<br>3 mode you can choose now.","summary":"Goyok is a jigsaw puzzle with the theme of movie and TV series cover pictures.","installs":"100,000+","minInstalls":100000,"maxInstalls":380660,"score":4.0855746,"scoreText":"4.1","ratings":3613,"reviews":1674,"histogram":{"1":591,"2":88,"3":141,"4":388,"5":2402},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":false,"size":"26M","androidVersion":"4.4","androidVersionText":"4.4 and up","developer":"Zoshy2","developerId":"Zoshy2","developerEmail":"syfoo135@outlook.com","developerWebsite":"https://syfoo-59147.web.app","privacyPolicy":"https://sites.google.com/view/syfoo135/privacypolicy?authuser=1","developerInternalID":"7924829755557788992","genre":"Puzzle","genreId":"GAME_PUZZLE","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Becgqxvqnv_vXjE31NNq8JnvDqkDng79UqHMmNIZfOyIITIzUY_kGWcyx6WaL4V5CbI","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xK7YDXbb_p6fS1dTO1s7sYA_6OGNYQ1z7cEXIM2kJ5z9E0rvp74zmMCtNXWMgOxxl68","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2KKZgQp65rbmqi4-ZwrC1R0pDGpjqYMjt4WD1gYQKu1q6qyFuE3yrRVy0UEguKEjhZMX","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/_Tz7MmYfjbVWRQzxRPapoJuIWgGCwmjs77NsCXjiUzWly-EV4APaIiWxOYUjkdjXx1I","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/iK5JVQN_5g8P_KLow6FCSZ1QhEvOy7HjDy8s9-bCGfC0wvRdvELcyTuHMtVR6me4IUw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FyRguKgkOglPDh83V-9B5m9pcZLfvMLnpj6wIk_9yBMSKC88tzagc64PrBMhSLl1Mg"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Apr 22, 2021","updated":1629086114000,"version":"1.0.9","recentChanges":"Fixed some bugs.","comments":["❤︎Love it! but..a bit of broblems Personally, this app is great!

You literally just click things to upgrade, and they take longer and longer each time. You can't win a fight against anyone stronger than you, and most people pay literally hundreds of dollars each month for pointless shiny things. So unless you plan to spend a lot of money don't bother to even download this game.","The reviews are as entertaining as the game. Every game is pay to win/dominate these days. Servers don't run on thank yous and programmers don't work for appreciation. With that said, you can easily play and enjoy this game without paying money. That includes playing on one of the top alliances as a ftp player. I've done it with multiple accounts on multiple servers. I also have a main account that I have put a decent amount of money into. It was well worth it. Love this game!","A great game that doesn't require pay to play in order to do well starting out. Been playing for 5 days and have accumulated 50 bucks worth of in game currency. A couple of bugs like having another game open on your phone will cause it to freeze out sometimes but all in all having a blast. As far as \"artillery game\" goes not sure but is a great strategy and kinda feels like COC or Evony online.","HORRIBLE customer service, pay to play I downloaded this game in February and discovered quickly that to compete, you have to be willing to shell out serious money, packs start at a dollar or 2 and quickly ramp up to $100, new packs being offered almost daily. There are a lot of features in the game (which is nothing like the ad, btw) which are interesting but customer service if something goes wrong is a nightmare. There is a well known issue with comps disappearing, I lost 3, too bad so sad.","Enjoyed playing this game for 2 or 3 days. After you get so far into it, there are long waits between being able to play unless you pay, which is fair enough, the developers need their money, but it does look a bit to expensive to me so I uninstalled the game instead. I tried watching adverts but quite a few wouldn't return you to the game and would require a forced close of the game to continue, losing the benefit if watching the advert, so I gave up on that fairly soon in the game."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.topwar.gp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.topwar.gp&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Bazooka Boy","description":"Blast through levels and destroy everything before you with a bunch of amazing weapons!

For every minute you spend actually playing, you'll have TWO minutes of mandatory ads to watch... But wait, that's not all, the game continuously has ads on the screen as well. But wait... not only do you have to watch ads, but they are deceptive... they put up fake buttons that don't end the ad, they take you to installation screens or OTHER ADs. And when you \"win\" a prize you have to watch another 30 second ad. Imagine watching 18 hours of Super Bowl for 3 hours of game play... yeah... not going to win any affection. I understand wanting to make money, but this is downright harassment. Oh, and you also get the same ads over and over and over and over and over and over and over ... I should have known this would happen, I installed this game based on ads from another game. The only upside: the game play appears to be true to the advertisement I saw unlike thousands of other games where the ad and the game play are completely unrelated.","For the record: I paid to remove the ads, it was worth it. I like playing this game - just to pass time and experiment with different guns. I am on level 1004 (but in truth, they repeat after about 250). Anyway, the first time around I learned that if you accept the last mystery outfit, the game will freeze the next time you reach 100%. So, I reinstalled the game and now I click \"lose it\" for the last mystery outfit. The first time around I couldn't play past about level 350.","More advertising than game! By a lot, too! For every 10 seconds of game play, you have to sit through a 30 second ad. I timed it, it's not an exaggeration. I have never seen a game this ad heavy before in my life. I thought it was a joke ar first. It's literally advertisement after advertisement. You get 3 bazooka shots MAX before a 30 second ad (or TWO!) Instant and permanent uninstall. Amazingly Ad inundated.","The game concept itself is good, and the mechanics are fine. But you'll spend as much time watching ads as you do playing the game. It takes 15 seconds to pass (or fail) a level, and after two attempts you have to watch an ad. Get free awards? Watch an ad to claim. Double your winnings? Ad. You get the idea. It's $2.99 to remove ads, but for what? There's no music, minimal sound effects, and very basic graphics. Zero effort was made into making this game look good or be enjoyable long term.","Little dude celebrates too damn early. It freezes at one scene. You have to play it several times before it will move on to the next level. Once you move on and it gets back to that particular scene it does it again, play it several times and...well, you get it... Well... other than being repetitive & not able to buy anything with all the coins you collect, it was ok to play."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.Lightneer.BazookaBoy","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Lightneer.BazookaBoy&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Extreme Car Driving Simulator","description":"Extreme Car Driving Simulator is the best car simulator of 2014, thanks to its advanced real physics engine \r\nEver wanted to try a sports car simulator?

I love the gameplay BUT the rounds are very short and there are way too many ads. Ads between rounds, ads when you open the shop or challenges. Anytime you click on something there's an ad. Way too many.","It's a cool and fun concept, and that's all that's good about it. It is INCREDIBLY buggy, and it's just an ad grinder. Every single time you start a new game an ad is getting prepared for you to watch after said game, and if you die. Even when you're not in a game, for example, editing your avatar, there's an ad every 8-12 seconds (yes, I counted), which at this point, is just abusing ad policy for mobile game creators.","Too many ads. Can't win or die without an ad there is the occasional ad but it just spams them. Like every three games is fine but every game is just dumb. Also how many notifications I get is mind blowing. Lemme watch stuff in 0eace without you blowing up my phone. Its fun to play but this stuff is so annoying I can't even give it two star.","Way too many ads it was like everything I clicked on there was an ad. I'd open the game and there's like two ads. If that was different the game would be fun as heck. But it's horrible because of this","Garbage game forces ads. Offers a multiplier for watching an ad and you have to watch an ad regardless if you accept the multiplier or not, then it doesn't even reward you after the forced ad. Typical like every other app. At least other apps are fun. Don't waste your time.

Ever since Inazuma dropped, my mobile couldn't handle some of the commissions. Example, the commission \"full speed ahead\" in Inazuma is very difficult since the gliding challenges would not load fast enough. Therefore couldn't reach the destination within the time limit. I would really appreciate if Mihoyo can fix this problem, because I have been struggling with this commission for some time now.","Great game, alone or with friends, and across pc or mobile. My favorite mobile game in recent years, and one that's kept me engaged for almost a year already. Art is beautiful, story and characters are memorable, and story progression isn't blocked on paying. This is a gacha game, so you can get better characters by paying, but I appreciate how the game doesn't feel like it requires it.","This game is amazing! It has interesting lore, the characters are well designed, the graphics are great, and the gameplay is overall fantastic. I would give it 5 stars but there's been a lot of bugs since the last few updates. It keeps kicking me off, leaving me forced to redo quests and battles and after the game starts everything's buggy. I just find it funnier than anything else,(EX: I saw a npc sitting without a chair) but it is kind of annoying to have to redo difficult battles and quests.","I usually play competitive games. MOBA like Dota, LOL or other games. It's my first time playing a game with an open world genre and to be honest this game gives me a lot of \"stress-free vibe\". The ambiance of the game, the angelic background music, the simple yet aesthetic design of the character and the world. Whenever I'm in a lot of negativity and stress, I play this game and it gives me peace and comfort. Thank you for making this game.","There is no reason why you shouldn't give this game a try, It's exciting, the graphics are phenomenal and there is so much story and detail! I understand the fact that, because the game is free, there needs favorable parts for the people that pay. Despite that, I would love if MiHoYo gave more primos, the grind needed to have a good chance for a 5* is insane."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Type Sprint: Typing Games, Practice & Training.","description":"Ready to challenge your brain and typing speed?

This is very life changing idea to be put in a game! Please fix and do some development! Love you all!","This game is so fun but the reason I gave it four stars and not five is because when I start a game I have to press on the keyboard thing and I have to press it so many times but it's fine I don't judge .when I first started playing I thought that the keyboard would just pop up it might just be me because every one just goes like so fast idk if u get it though. Sorry I write to much.","The developers of this game lie to you. This game isn't even multiplayer. I just turned off the wifi on my phone and it still said that im playing with other players. They just throw some random numbers at you about how many players there arr still, but it's all a lie. They just want to make easy money with you watching the ads and such and they USE you for that. The game overall is a great concept, but they made it the most terrible way imaginable. One star. Would not recomment.","It's a decent game. Sad that all the players are bots. Also the ads are SUPER ANNOYING. A little less ads makes the game better.

No levels, coins, gems, telling you what to do, times or buying with real money. You can make the food how you want to. But please add more people and a soup pot. Still this game deserves 5 stars.","This game is really fun! Not much ads, no lag for me, but the reason why I gave it 4 stars is because sometimes it glitches me out of the game but over all its very good! And its not just for ages 6-8 like it says, I'm 10 and I'm still playing, my little cousin is 5 and she is playing and understands it well! We both love it and hope another character joins to be fed!! What I really like to do is mix 🥦 and 🥕 together and boil them and make 🥦 and 🥕 stew! This is the best cooking game ever.","I love this game but It needs a little bit more things to do like maybe a place to make sandwiches, microwave, coffee maker, pancake and waffle maker, place to make salads, place to make burgers, place to make pasta, place to make Popsicles, and Things they should add like bannas, ranch, milk, cheese, cinnamon, sugar, syrup, eggs, and bacon. But that is ideas I have I don't think it will be added but it would be cool if it did. But overall the game's awesome. Just needs more is all.","This game provides a huge scope for the imagination. There are so many food choices and ways to cook them. There are no promts or rules, just freeplay. And I think people out of the recommended age range (like me) can still enjoy it. I play this game for hours in a row. I even noticed a vegetarian mode in the simple settings menu that takes away meat from the refrigerator. That is so considerate. Also, no ads! I 100% love and recommend this game.","I love this game and all other TOCA games. It would be a 5 star, but there are a few things to improve. It would be nice if there were more varieties in fruits, veggies, more bowls, pans, stuff like that. Other than that, the game is fine."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.tocaboca.tocakitchen2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tocaboca.tocakitchen2&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"100 Years - Life Simulator","description":"Make choices and take charge of your life story.

It's take too much time. It is in 69% only. It is not Increasing. Please don't ignore this problem of downloading.....

This game keeps getting new games added so you never get bored of the game. It also has an air you can play against which I'm glad about cause I got no one to play with. 😥 The minigames are great, but I wish there was a game mode like survival or a campaign or something. But even without that I think it's a great game.","Pretty good game overall. Though, I have some problems with it. Firstly, the hard bot seems unbalanced. On some games, like shuriken bamboo or basketball, the bot is almost impossible to beat, but then on games like chess or king of the yard, they're super easy to beat. Secondly, it seems like you put no effort into some maps. Specifically, tanks. The map on that is literally two rocks. Please fix these to enhance your game :)","The game sucks you can't beat the bots and the games are rigged like in pool if a ball gets close to a net then it will just go in even of you put all you're power into the shot. And in pingpong the ball goes through the paddle. And in tic tac toe the computers are enstien level good.","AMAZING!!!! Ive had this game for a long long time, and I must say I love the new updates! Even the new logo looks beautiful. It would be cool if you add a thing that counts how many hours/minutes you spent playing a certain game, just an idea. :).","A number of interesting games that are sort of similar. It's fun in that you can play against the have it you can play against a friend. I enjoy the ping pong game the most, I think. I'd enjoy more games like hangman (where the players chose a word), darts, or five-in-a-row. The music in the home screen can't be turned off and is obnoxious. But it's a fun pass-time for friends."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.JindoBlu.TwoPlayerGamesChallenge","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.JindoBlu.TwoPlayerGamesChallenge&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Fashion Battle - Dress to win","description":"The most entertaining free game of the year is already here!

It's frustrating because each time I have to close the game and wait a few minutes to go back to playing. Other than that I enjoy it very much. Can you ease do something to fix the problem with the ads so the game can be enjoyed.","I think this is a fun game. Cute clothing options and customization options. However, I've played long enough to notice how the scoring isn't very consistent. if the model does well in a round, they will purposely score you lower, there's also no telling exactly how anything is scored. It's just kind of random, you can't strategize. But overall, I do enjoy this game.","I love the game, and all that lot of good effort, but there is a bug ( not sure if a bug). So, whenever a person somebody basically looks like me last time on night club or any other dress title. And I look like them they win, but if it's opposite they would look the same as them and me as myself they would win again. And I feel like these people are bots they always dress the same and again and again. This Review is from a mobile player.","This is a good game and it is quite addictive but there are way to many adds and some ppl do bad on purpose I kind of wish they would be really good and I can actually battle. Also when I think something is bad and I did good the 'judges' would give them a really good score when there outfits don't match. To be honest this game is really good and addictive but there are some down side to it - one ur queen u carnt go anywhere else ur continually playing the same rounds -","Very fun actually, and super addicting. I've been playing pretty consistently for almost 6 months now and have over 30,000 gems. My one and only problem is I have nothing to do with them. There are items I can buy with the gems, but it says the game needs to update. So far, the game hasn't had any updates since I've downloaded it. So.

Well pleased with it. the only thing I don't like is that. it keeps trying to get me to buy better ships. in my opinion you should be able to play to win them. not pay for them. because it will present no challenge for me. but it's a decent game. 👍","Uses scumbag tactics to get you to download. Blares the sound loud on their ad. Edit. I was playing a different game and your ad appeared. The ad was WAY too loud. Anytime I see companies do that. Automatic bad review.","Edit: Doesnt explain unclear instructions or rules.-Don't bother unless you want to spend MEGA money to get anywhere. There are videos to watch for extra life or free stuff but not in comparison in what you have to spend to keep going even when you have top tier ship.Little to no instructions and what you do get is confusing.If you think you get it think again.You can level up ships but each star is 25 sub-levels that you have to max along with power ups that are 25 levels different coin types.","I like the game but dislike the match making. I can only guess that the players on the top of the leaderboards have paid their way to the top because when you are placed in bronze 3 league and you are subsequently pitted against a player in gold 1 league, who can mysteriously and magically gather 15k to 25k points lead in rounds that are frankly not worth that amount of points. Devs, something needs to be done about the fairness of your matchmaking because this could be a 5 star game!","Played forever. Had fun. Never cheat. Game now tells ne hack detected and shuts down. Freshly restored phone. Same thiing. Hack detected. Wasted time to get locked out of the game. Glad i hesitated and spent no money to support the company. Beware all.

The ads are a joy killer. It's what's forcing me to give this only 1 star. It Literally plays a 1 min ad every 3 moves you make and sometimes after every move and 9 times out of 10 the ad don't have an (X) forcing you to tap your home button. it's awful like being covered with flies. You know how to shoo them away but you can't. So pester some.","To Stretch Guy Makers, The game you've created is very good, I just have one dislike with it and that's with the Ads. There's one every level and it's just annoying, it's even whilst playing in the level. I'd give it a 5 Star Rate, but it's just too much Ads. Big well done on making the game just calm down with the ads, just too much. I love the game and there's even ads on like level 4 or lower. Just stop the ads please. Thanks, From Lexi's Experiments.","So many ads, it's not worth getting. Just started a level, stretched one arm and an add started. You get several ads during every level. DURING! it has made it impossible to enjoy, so I have deleted it. I would suggest only downloading it to buy so as to avoid ads - cuttently £3.19. I've deleted instead as I think they're taking the xxxx with the excessive ads.","This game is very fun itself but they are too many ads. They are ads after every single level. Even in the middle of a level they are ads. In fact, they are ads after almost every single move I make. I wish this game had less ads. This game would have been better if it had less ads.","So many ads it is really really really annoying and Soo impossible! A lot better than paper fold. Well done Erin Aye tell your 4 year old that I said 'good job!'. I am on level two hundred and something!! Pretty damn good!!! But not as good as your 4 year old!!!! 650!!!!!!!!! Very happy for her or him!!!!!!!!😀😀😀😀😀😀😗😗😗 This game should be rated G or PG!!😗😗 This stresses me out but paper fold makes me FURIOUS!!!!!!!!!!

It keeps crashing. Sometimes it picks up where you left off, other times items are returned to the pile and sometimes it takes all the progress you made away. I really enjoy this game and wish that these glitches would be fixed. Just now had three items left and it stopped again (mind you this is one game, it has taken 30 minuets) now it says that I ran out of lives. Great, now I have to start all over. Need to find a game to replace this one.","Quite easy. Unlike the 3d match you start off at easy levels and levels get harder as you. Also you tap on the items to select rather dragging them to the bottom. The only thing you need to watch is that the correct item has been selected. If the boxes at the bottom fill up before matching 3 then the game is over.","So far, I'm enjoying the game, but found it unplayable with the ads, so I got the paid version. My only complaint is that I can't play it untimed because I prefer games with no time pressure. Would give 5 stars if I could turn off the time countdown.","It's a surprisingly addictive game. The first few levels are pretty easy.... But, get through it because it becomes more challenging pretty quickly and involves strategy and foresight! Also, the touch/response reaction time is awesome even on my \"basic\" phone!","The Candy Crush Ad locks down my game and wont allow me to close the ad once the its finished.

Also the game is very different to the advert.","Honestly it is a great game but it can use some updates. For example the nail polish colors. I wish there was more of an option. Also, I wish you could mess up; if you know what I'm saying. The game is always so easy I wish the customers were a bit more picky, like in realife. Also, id maybe like to see some more diversity. There is clearly only white and black customers. Maybe we could see some Asian, Middle Eastern, and Hispanic customers. Although, the game is pretty great overall.","That a wonderful game , I have downloded it for my younger sister which is o ly 2 years old and she plays this game with a great fun ... .. but I have give it 4 stars they can improve some thing in game as they should give more nail powers in it , more nail designs and most impo , they should increase difficulty level as its for 5 to 10 years old kids","The whole general idea of the game is a good one, but it gets boring pretty fast. There isn't much to do and half of the new stuff you can get are only obtained by ads. There could be more stuff to do (like buying designs or choosing furniture)","I am very dissapointed in this game,in the demo they advertised us the possibility of hurting our clients therefore making them Not pay us the max amount and making the game less bland but in the actual gameplay , it is impossible.Furthermore, the nails seem to just shape themselves when applying the acrilic powder (elongating the bead around to make the nail take shape) making the gaming experience totally automated(1)"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.crazylabs.acrylic.nails","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crazylabs.acrylic.nails&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Tomb of the Mask","description":"Tomb of the Mask is an arcade game with an infinite procedurally generated vertical labyrinth.

But oh dear God the monetization here is horrendous. The energy system is atrocious. I burn through it all in five minutes, and when that's done, it asks me to sign up for a subscription. To an indie arcade game?! Hell no! And the $30 \"No Subscription\" option is just as bad. I have purchased games that offers other-worldy experiences for less. Do not recommend.","This is the third time I have downloaded this app\\game. I completed it 2 and their are 325 levels... I played it alot. It is SOOOOO fun. I recommend. Also when you run out of energy you can do arcade mode. Also you can turn of music and sound if you wanted to play quietly without disturbing anyone. Again great app, recommend to you.","OK, look: This is one of very few modern mobile games that is actually worth trying. Yes, there's lots of ads, but those can be easily removed without any kinds of mods. Playgendary, I have one request for this game: Switch port. It would feel right at home on the Switch, seeing as it has a touch screen, and could also use the sticks or d-pad. $5 on the eShop and I could see it being pretty popular.","Okay, originally I gave this a 4 star because I don't like the snakes, but the pop up ads are horrible, they pop out of no where and usually tricking you into pressing the \"buy\" button. Constantly you have to watch an ad for everything, to get a life, before and after the game, when you enter a game, for a chest! Sometimes during the game, despite this, it's a fun game.","Perfect game This game is really fun, but my problem is the energy system. You can only have 5 energy at a time, and energy is so valuable because you literally can't play the game without it. I wish maybe you could have like 10 energy at a time....?? And the long dragon snake is just too surprising so you can't get out of the way quick enough. If you dont fix the energy system it would be cool if you put 2 revives instead of 1 per level.. but still, this game is so fun. Played all 450 levels!!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.playgendary.tom","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playgendary.tom&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"BitLife - Life Simulator","description":"How will you live your BitLife?\r\n\r\nWill you try to make all the right choices in an attempt to become a model citizen sometime before you die?

But no you still have to pay to go back in your person's life. Kinda makes it alot less fun. But you guys go ahead. Have people pay for a membership without saying there's more to pay. For \"God mode\" and then let's make them pay again even though they wanted to play this free phone game so much they spent 10$ already","The games slow and crashes often. I played the game when it was newer and didn't have any problems but then an certain update (which I can't remember what it added) then it crashes (which makes you lose everything you've done that year) and takes a minute just to change screen. At first I thought it was my phone then I upgraded to a new phone and had the same problems then I learned that some of my friends had the problems too. Not all of them though, if the game runs good nice if not delete it","I've never really liked simulators before....this game though... I can't say a lot about it because I'm still exploring....The ads are annoying but it's only because I'm not ready to pay for it to go away get.... but the games seriously growing on me.... I guess you'd really have to give it a go to understand what I'm talking about.....","Hello. I love your game and have been playing for a few years now. I just started to have this issue where the game keeps freezing up. I uninstalled and reinstalled and started again but then it frozen again. Will let me do different things but doesn't display that I did them or that I pressed age. It just freezes. Will give 5 star when fixed","I love the game. Literally the best game I've ever played. But the problem is that You guys don't update Android as much as you do apple, so all of the advertisements that come up (such as the royalty update, the pro sports updat, and the mafia update) Android users can't play it until months later. While apple users get to play it once they see it. But that's the only problem that I have with this game.

First one is a glitch/bug... if you have more than 1 Telepath in your team, one of them will shoot at absolutely nothing. The beam will just fly off in a random direction. The second thing is there is no way to take time off for opening chests other than with gems. Times for opening chests are quite long and there should be a way to maybe watch an ad to take off a couple hours or so.","Pretty good game. Reminds me of archero but less challenging. At a point where every time I open the game and launch a mission, when It gets to the point to pick your first squad mate, nothing shows up on the cards and when you click to select it just continues loading and only gives you the option not to pick anyone. Then when you reach the point to pick a power up, same issue, the pictures on the cards never appear just continuously loads, please fix for 5 stars","Just an ad money farm, lets you play a bit with an ad every so often, then after a while makes you watch an ad between every single level of a map, essentially forcing you to pay for no ads or putting up with whatever trash the ads are trying to get you to download next every 2 minutes. Gameplay isnt half bad, but not worth the time spent watching adverts.","This game is really fun and worth at least trying out. In my experience the ads weren't as bad as what others are saying but they're still there between every level. After about an hour of playing you will have played pretty much all the game has to offer besides getting the other heroes, I wish the world's would get progressively harder or had longer rooms with different enemies. Would play much more if there was just more to the game","Would give it 5, but a bug has popped up. I am stuck in the 12/12 room at the end of a world and can't seem to progress even though I already got rewards at the end. Gameplay: Fun and easy, ads make it look dumber and less involved then it is. It is a card collection/RPG style arcade shooter. You collect units, upgrade them with coins, and do missions. World's so far have been unique enough to be enjoyable. Ads/IAP's are part of it, but I haven't felt like you need to partake. 4/5."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.eightsec.Shootero","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eightsec.Shootero&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Animal Transform Race - Epic Race 3D","description":"Are you in for a joyful and speedy transformer race?

I want to 4 stars but I gave 5 stars because I love this game so I gave 5 stars. Why I want to give 4 stars because after some levels it was so difficult so I want to give 4 stars. Ok anything I gave 5 stars happy ok thank you for giving cat escape","The game is amazing with cute costumes and nice trails, but the only thing wrong with it is that it would be better if you keep less ads. But the game is really really nice.","It's fun and challenging kinda feel bad for the little guy but one thing just..doesn't grow on me and it's the ads I don't know why but it's kinda annoying but still fun even when your offline","So cute and fun! Really want to get the little guy out! Only thing bugged me was learning to control him with finger. Felt bad when I rammed him into walls, furniture. Made him look blind, me sad about it. Finally found a skin I liked to change to like level 177, but it didn't take. Oh well. Had to search for help on the thing that protects him from getting whacked if he doesn't move. Should have had how to tip for it! Fun!","I really wish that this game had a joystick mode where you controlled the movemnt of the cat with a joystick instead of the cat following your finger because sometimes the cat would go in a random direction and would get me caught. To get an earned skin, I had to watch an add all the way through once, but then it didn't give me my skin so I had to watch another one.

Bugs: the only thing that (almost) makes us angrier than the piggies.","comments":["Geez... AB2 is getting worse. I haven't had gems in forever and the game glitches out in the middle of an ad taking 70 gems from me. For a game that people spend money on, you'd expect it to run in tip top shape. It's such a shame what this once fun game has been reduced to... And to add to this, I've been shut out of my profile and am not able to ressurect it. So, good on you ab2! You have a great scheme going and I believe you got a total of $200 from me over a period of 3 years.","DON'T CLICK ON ADS! Pay to play game, and Rovio cheats. Birds weaken during BOSS levels. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. This isn't the same fun game we loved. They also need to reduce prices. I don't mind paying, but their fees for gems needed to win levels are ridiculous. $20 or $30 at a minimum is nuts. And it takes forever to save enough gems. Shame on you, Rovio. You destroyed a great game with your greed. *** And don't expect a response from them, either. They obviously stopped caring about us. ***","I originally gave it a full 5 stars. But now, I'm not sure. The game is absolutely fun! ...Unntil you have to constantly take care of a hatchling that nearly everything in game is dependant on. Eventually, it gets harder and harder to take care of that bird. You have to constantly feed it apples everyday to upgrade your birds and slingshot. I wanna knock down some pigs, not constantly take care of a hatchling that needs feeding a certain amount every 24 hours. This game is still good though.","Gameplay is fine, but for some reason the game says you can't download the whole file from the store. This seems inaccurate as you can download over 2 GB directly from the play store. As such I will not be giving this app storage permissions.","I have enjoyed playing this game however there are a number of problems that make this game unfun like having to install newer versions repeatedly and the wait time between screens . the newest version is much faster and more enjoyable. July 29,2021 was my first update on a new install of this game. It is now one week later and a new update is required ....again . The average update is 50 mb. Plus ad storage .

It's got really good graphics. Reward schemes are good. Daily rewards are given promptly. But since past one week the daily mystery box gift has stopped. It says \" contacting \" even if you have good speed WiFi. A gift box opens and says \" unable to connect to server\" . So a request to please solve the problem. Your game is a really hot favourite of mine. So hoping you will get this message and solve the issue.","This is the best designed \"match 3\" game I've ever played. But I guess the developers aren't making enough from in-game purchases now because they've added ads. And because of the way they're set up, every time I need to restart a level I'm forced to back all the way out to the level list so they can show the ad - which I'll ignore. Then I have to do extra steps to get back to where I was. I just updated hoping that had been changed. It hasn't & I'm out of patience. Goodbye Candy Crush.","This is my go-to game and by far the best Candy Crush game of the bunch. I just started playing in April 2021 and have reached level 2872. Each puzzle level is fun and some can be quite the challenge. I love it. My only complaint is how costly this game truly can be. I didn't really keep track at how much I was spending until I viewed my monthly bank statement. Enjoy the game but be careful, those in app purchases can really add up fast!","Best game ever. My stress reliever. I always challenge my husband. I wish they can come up with a better rewards and competitions. Like cash rewards and solid prices. Imagine getting a big basket of all the sweets you swipe everyday😜😜😀👌. Trips and more, that will be awesome.","Although I do like the game and play daily I rated it 1 star because I don't get videos for extra moves which causes me to have to play the same level several times. I refuse to buy gold or pay gold just to make 1 additional move. I also do like how people are allowed to just sit on a square instead of completing that square so the line is finished and we get the prize. If it's a team effort and they don't participate they shouldn't get the prize."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.king.candycrushsodasaga","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.king.candycrushsodasaga&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Sniper 3D: Fun Free Online FPS Shooting Game","description":"Ready for a free action-packed multiplayer FPS game?

I've played a long time and invested a ton of cash. I don't mind spending when it's worth it. Far too many ways for players to cheat using hacks. This should be a priority instead of new weapons. Can't compete with cheats.","SOOOOO MANY ADS! BEFORE AND AFTER EVERY SINGLE STAGE!!! YOU HAVE TO USE THE BACK BUTTON TO EXIT ADS, THE \"X\" DOESN'T WORK!!! I'm positive this is done on purpose purely to annoy and bully you into buying in game currency! This game WAS fun before the ads took over. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NON EXISTENT!!! I'm refusing to invest anymore $ on this app till the incessant nagging from the ads is HEAVILY REDUCED!!!","Everytime I exit the game all my accumulated skulls will go back to zero. It's upsetting since I try to collect them as much as possible for them to be gone in instant. Also it lags, the character will fall off the building making impossible to shoot them. I hope you can fix it better. Thank you!","This game would have gotten a 5 star. However they are all about spending money. It won't let you finish a mission just because you built a rifle that said tier 5 instead of 4. It shouldn't matter about the rifle. Guess I'll delete this game. I don't recommend it.","A entertaining game, the missions are described in a concise manner, short and to the point with no opportunities for confusion about the objective. There is a wide range of rewards made available through completing goals within the game; for example, once you reach level 5 in experience there is an achievement made available and you can collect money. The money in the game can be used to buy more, or upgrade already owned equipment. The missions get progressively more difficult.

One of the best games I have ever played! It is so fun spinning the wheel and having her dance and dressing her up! I used to think that it was impossible to get the jackpot, but after a LONG LONG LONG time, I had finally got it! It gave me 5000 coins and was so worth it! Also the little dances are ADORABLE. Just wanna say the rumors are a lie and just YouTubers tryna get fame, likes, and views. Don't believe these YouTubers! Anyways this game is totally worth the download!!","Not an actual review for the game but I just feel like explaining this: My Talking Angela doesnt have people looking through her eyes, those are just rumors from years upon years ago and it's safe to play this game.","Amazing, wonderfull app.. But the fact that people say \"There is a camera in her eyes\" or \"help i played it at 3AM and.. \" It was a rumor its fake there is NO camera in her eyes and if there was the hacker (Person behind all of this.) wouldve gotten arrested. Thank you.","I like this game but u need to improve this game so much . Although this game is fantastic and enjoying, I thinks the person who made this thought a very very gud idea 💡but some things are there to be improved so I am going to tell them. Firstly pls try to give less adds and less notifications.. as well as we have to buy the things pls remove this thing. I hope u will get helps from our review if they are gud or bad ..... Thanks 😊","This is a nice game people say there's a camera but there's no more!the criminal is in jail for 30 years thank you for the police :) I loved this game when I was a kid and there were no cameras when then I rare this 4 stars because there's no lot that much things to do but I love it!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.outfit7.mytalkingangelafree","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.outfit7.mytalkingangelafree&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Crossy Road","description":"Join over 200 MILLION players worldwide and experience Hipster Whale's massive viral #1 hit!\r\n\r\nSame device multiplayer: Compete against your friends and family on the same device.\r\n\r\nPlay Crossy Road on the Big Screen with Android TV! \r\n\r\nWhy did the Chicken cross the road?\r\nWhy did the Pigeon leave THAT there?\r\nWhy did Specimen 115 abduct that cow?\r\nWhy did Unihorse eat all that candy?\r\n\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n - Collect over 150 retro-styled, pop art inspired characters \r\n - Cross roads, train tracks, and rivers – endlessly hop forever \r\n - Dodge traffic in a candy wonderland with the Android Robot \r\n - Simple, pure, innovative gameplay \r\n - Free to play\r\n\r\n\r\nHave any problems or suggestions?

This game really is just a game were you jump past cars, trains etc but for some reason I really like it. The game has challenges ever 24h (You play against others around the globe to see who can go the furthest within the game) I like how it is different maps for differnt characters.I recomend this game to thoose who are a little bit competative, have paitience and are willing to keep trying to get better. hope you like the game :) Sorry for any spelling errors in here.","Woah, this game is really fun! The characters are cute and the rules are simply-simple and also I don't get why people complain about the game itself being boring? It's not boring it's fun! They should atleast appreciate it, yet they just complain. And others complain about the loads of ads Why don't you turn off your wifi because it's an OFFLINE GAME.","This is the most generous and overall fun game ever. Let me explain how this beautifully sculptured game describes itself perfectly. 1st of all, it DEOSN'T shove ads in your face or offers, I CAN RESPECT THAT. And if you wanted to you could turn ads and stuff off in which I find very clever and thoughtful of the company who made this. OTHER GAMES ARE LITTERED WITH THOSE THINGS. And the gameplay is very engaging and tipitty top. I got this in microsoft store (PC) And am writing this on bluestacks","I hate the ads. Played for 2 minutes, got an ad, and then couldn't get out of it. There were no '×' buttons, and I couldn't go back to the game after closing the app and coming back. Idk if this is a bug or not, but if it is please fix it devs, I want to play your game.","I like this game for calming my anxiety. It's simple, but really fun yet doesn't frustrate you when you die.

Also, the play-to-ad ratio is way too high. It only takes 10 seconds to blast through a stack, then you have to watch a 30 second ad. That's right... 10 seconds of play to 30 seconds of ad. You can pay $3.29 to remove ads, but that's not really optional if you want to keep your sanity. Technically free to load and play, but... Seriously? Bottom line (IMO): It's not worth the money. Rather than remove the ads, I removed the game.","Better play this with your wi-fi turned off. There's ads every after level and 15 seconds plus before the [×] mark appears.","Ok this game is pretty cool and original but there's some people that realy want do get no ads/advertisements because that's annoying and there's some people that dont like the ads video because there's some sexual and the childrens will download the game but this game will deleted but im not saying that this game got not his mistake because he dont create the video ads right? So dont say that the creator is bad because he just created the game for 'fun' so if you dont like ADS off the wifi :)","This is a great time killer. Very satisfying to play, but the thing that prevents this game from me giving them a 5 star is the amount ads. You don't need this many ads you guys have over 100 million downloads you should be pulling in enough revenue to not include ads in the game itself.","This game is amazing I enjoyed the lot when I play this game I feel very relaxing and it is very intresting gama please made more game like this and very important point It did not used a net we can play this game any wher any time and with without net and I I did not have the words to say obout this it is super duper amazing'"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.azurgames.stackball","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azurgames.stackball&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Dancing Race","description":"Want to enjoy music but the old way is too boring?

Several features that make it fun and allow you freedom to do almost anything you want. Had it rated at 5*, until the new update dropped and they changed the cost of server immigration. I started on server 188, and moved to server 21. When I moved it cost 12 immigration tickets, equivalent to $60 if bought outright. After the new update, if I decided to go back to 188, it would now be 60 tickets, equivalent to $300. That is laughable. 1*/5*","I Finally have found another game that I'm enthralled with. I thought I wouldn't like it because of the monsters (i.e ZOMBIES) oh contrary. Even though it's not anything like the advertisements it's still alright. Just bring your patience and u to won't be able to put it down. To the Developers I may change my mind and give it 5 stars, depending upon any bugs that I may encounter after the recent upgrade(s.)","A game that can be highly addictive. It has a steep learning curve and requires A LOT of time and dedication. While is it an undoubtedly pay-to-win game, you can still enjoy most of its content playing at your own level and pace. The game's events are fairly generous, and there are ALWAYS events. The biggest criticisms are its p2w nature and the big bullying the weaker. I highly recommend joining a competent and helpful alliance, and keeping resources in your bag where it can't be plundered.","Game is excellent for those who want to pay for everything . For us few whom don't pay to play the game takes more time th,an anyone could expect , we don't have day's to spend collecting resources when we end up eventually getting what we need , we get plundered by players who are always more than 6 Levels higher than us , how are we supposed to grow when the game is against the non paying players , there has to be a cut-off point as to how many levels higher a player can be before attacking .","False advertisement. Game is not what the ads look like. It's also glitchy and very slow. Unless you pour money into this game your growth is very limited and unless you like sending troops out and wait to see the results there really isn't much else to this game. It's slow!

Works great on mobile devices, dosen't try to be something it's not. This is exactly what a mobile game should be.

The only thing that is getting me real mad is there is so much ads, you cant go a second without seeing ads. IT LITERLLY AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SCREEN WHEN YOU ARE FIGHTING. But the only thing is that is kind of... dont know... But its weird. Like hitting people with a bat?! Killing, hurting. Dont play this game if you dont like that stuff. But its pretty good. I give this a 3/5.","Its a great fighting game. Its simple and i can quickly memerize the controls. It is fun and not too easy. It is a challenging game but winnable. Its about strategy and smarts which i like. I finished it in only a few days. The adds are pretty often but but im able to get around them. I can understand because its free but they pop up a little too often. Cant wait for more content.","While a pretty fun game most of the time, I have some gripes with the minimalistic controls. They're not really the best for a fighting game such as this, especially the double tap for the fall-back and rush attacks. Plus, having to retreat to block usually nullifies it's usefulness, as most of the attacks that can't break a block won't be able to follow you if you're walking back.

Not to mention the fact that this game has so many ads that not even turning on airplane mode could remove some of them. Also the visuals look somehow worse than a PS1 game, how is that even possible! If someone forced me to beat this game or have them shoot me, I'd pull the trigger myself. ~Haremf*****249","This game is bland. All the levels keep repeating and they're all no challenge whatsoever. The ads are just too much. You don't even get to keep the characters you unlock. You have them for one level and then you're back with the original and that one mini game where you throw money at your furniture, it always ends up getting furnished the same way and the game's honestly just bad quality altogether.","I love robbery games and I'm so glad you made this i will give you two stars but unfortunately this game is same with a new texture. All levels are easy except one because it's broken. Everything feels like a chore. The extra characters are dumb there generic and bright. The prison escape game is broken it doesn't work properly. The objects are there for one round. I all the way to 100 which says alot","This game was fun but, why its rated so low is due to the lack of doing anything really, you just collect money. I wish you could change clothing or something, or at least buy or upgrade houses or land but, there is nothing to do other than unlock skins that doesn't work. I wish this will get better over time but, like most apps like this, I doubt it but, who knows, also it sometimes lags or crashes.","This game is just truly magnificent. The aspects of drip and robbing is life changing. I believe that people who play this game ascend beyond human comprehension. I love this game because the scenes where it has the diamond testers and 6ix9ine is just mind-blowingly astronomical. People who play this game don't need other mobile games. This game makes other games look like 0 stars. The greatest part about this game is that it's free. The only criticism I have is that most people don't play it."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.ei.robmaster3d","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ei.robmaster3d&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Skate Space","description":"Game of Skateboard.\r\nEnjoy battles and chats in multiplayer mode.\r\nOne park per person is given.

You have options as mastering levels or going freely on maps! You can customize your character too. You can add things to your map and change trick speed and more. There's no adds either or a long loading screen. You can grow Your skills and master all moves and ramps. Recommend to 7-8 + (Cause controls can be difficult without a tutorial)","This game is great. The trick animations are cool and the park creation is fantastic. But for getting good at this game there is a noticeable learning curve in getting high points for tricks. Also, the currency system is rather steep to get ahold of and you will have to grind a lot of you don't want to pump money into this game. Other than that, Skate Space is just a fun way to pass time and do some insanely cool stunts.","To be completely honest, this game fun but I don't think its at it's full potential. I like how it feels like skate 3 and how u can edit your own parks, but instead of having to unlock tricks, u should be able to do all of them. If your thinking about getting this game, I highly recommend getting it, though it's not the best, it still holds up.","Very fun game. The idea of the game (skateboarding) came across very well. You can do a bunch of cool tricks and edit your map. You can also change your map and your character. The overall performance is very good as well. It takes a bit of getting used to but when you do, it is a very fun game to play. If I could I would rate this game higher. It's a 10/10 for me, I hope you'll enjoy it to.","The game is AMAZING! You can ride a skateboard do cool tricks The p One thing I wish for is when you go on the board I wish you could flick the joystick up.

I'm up to level 9 of the insane puzzles, but every time I click to play it, a different (lower) puzzle opens that I have already completed. I'll back out to the main menu and try again, but will get yet another different puzzle. For example, I'll get puzzle 7, then 3, then 6, all instead of 9 which I should be getting to play. As well, a few puzzles refer to \"hand\" in the clues but \"head\" on the grid itself. Otherwise I'm really enjoying this app/game","I love playing this game, but all of the problems in the game stop me! In the Normal levels once you get to level 172 at least one of the clues is in a different language which prevents you from completing the puzzle. Once you reach level 38 in the Hard level it won't let you go any farther - and the same problem in the insane level. You can't go past level 8. Sure there are some spelling mistakes, but the glitches need to be fixed! Disappointing..","Very nice game! The levels are adequately challenging based on difficulty. I found this game through an ad. Given the amount of scam advertisements these days, I assumed the game would not be as advertised at all but it surprisingly is just as depicted. There's also no annoying ads popping up every few seconds like in other games. You only get 1 after each puzzle but they tend to be short. And if you play higher difficulty levels the timing between ads is ok since it takes a while to complete.","I really love these kinds of logic problems. They're fun and entertaining. This app is a great concept with good design and godawful implementation. A lot of the clues are written clunkily, as if they've been translated a few times, and some of them are straight up wrong. Not to mention the app's lack of zoom function for larger puzzles. It has a wide variety of puzzles, though not all actually function.","Some bugs! The first \"insane\" puzzle all the clues say \"hand\" and the puzzle says \"arm\". I had to re-do it several times. When you saw the puzzle wrong it gives you the option to erase your mistakes, but every time I did that it started the puzzle over completely.

We read all your reviews carefully to make the game even better for you.Please leave us some comments to let us know why you love our game and what you&#39;d like us to improve it!","comments":["I actually think that this isn’t that great that the previous one. I honestly loved the older version to the point I play it the whole day, but I can’t seem to find it. Disappointing. It was clean, simple and just relaxing. I didn't mind the ads since you can play it offline and you can have additional bottles for a single ad. Please, if the developer/s sees this comment, please take this into consideration. Or release another game or apk with the older one because that used to be my favorite.","This is one of those mindless kind of games you play when you can't get to sleep at night. That's not to say it's bad at all. It's actually quite good at what it's trying to achieve. It's not bogged down with story when it shouldn't be, It's mostly very pleasant to look at, and there's not too many ads. Um...the only thing I might change is the art for the flasks...I am a perv but they kind of look like condoms ngl. But, yes pretty entertaining, very satisfying. Would totally donate art for it.","I'm at level 710 and I have 100 coins. There are no rewards for completing the puzzles which forces you to watch ads to get coins. Isn't completing 700 levels deserving of at least something? The colors are also kinda gross. Brown, gray, puke-green, yellow and orange make me want to vomit.... I suggest adding more rewards and changing the color pallete. The actual puzzle is fine. Just fine. Good for passing time. Needs work though.","ADS ALL THE TIME. Way too many ads, which sucks because the game really can be addictive... but there is an ad in between EVERY LEVEL, EVERY restart, EVERY time you want to replenish your \"undo's\"; and if that's not bad enough, every time you leave the app (say for a phone call or to check another app) they plan another ad when you come back to it, even if you just watched one before you left!!! Honestly I played a lot of levels, but I'm sick of it - uninstalling!","Some ads will go to a black screen after it plays then knock you out of the game completely. When back in, you start allover. An ad is played after every game. I watched more ads than I played the game. It is a cute game but I just wanted to play and didn't get to. The issues I had made it unenjoyable so sadly, I will be deleting. Good luck in making it better for others."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"sortpuz.water.sort.puzzle.game","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sortpuz.water.sort.puzzle.game&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Need for Speed™ No Limits","description":"Claim the crown and rule the underground as you race for dominance in the first white-knuckle edition of Need for Speed made just for mobile – from the game developer that brought you Real Racing 3. \r\n\r\nBuild the ride that shows your style with a range of cars and customizations.

With the nitro and drifting. This is the full package. Of the need. The NEED FOR SPEED. I just wish you could make a more larger map. This time don't add boundaries a white line should tell you this is the race line. And make bigger jumps. And lastly scenes of the player and Kim, Tyler, Darius and all the people not just words and pictures talking. The game sometimes crashes for an unknown reason","Good game BUT 1.FUEL It limits your experience. At least do 1 fuel per race and lower the gold for the refill 2. Even if you pay, you have to pay more. The game isn't generous. It's not giving money, gold etc. and the items you win to upgrade stuff is like lottery. Also, when replaying a stage it takes fuel 3. EXTREMELY overpriced. Vip, store even with game currency everything is too pricey. EA can do better than this. At least the campaign shouldn't be that limited. I'm done with the payments","I love the graphics, animations, n the concept, but I really hate how time consuming this game can be 4 us to progress. It's almost impossible to without paying anything with real money. Some events even need certain cars to join, but it's really difficult to get the blueprints free through other chapters. In the end, you'd have to pay to but the blueprints. Spareparts to upgrade are also hard to get, which again resulting you to pay to get them, which I won't do cuz it's not worth it.","Going through the reviews. Not a very good game if you have to pay to win. Underground is a joke, especially if the car you are racing is faster than you. At least in career you can hit cars to slow them down. Underground you race against a ghost car that has no damage and can drive through cop car. Lol","Good quality cars are expensive, getting blueprints for free, is a nightmare . Getting the necessary upgrades for your car expensive, Gold is expensive, VIP points are expensive. Basically if u are a casual gamer like me it good but fuel runs out too quickly. Think abt this, I once saw a Lamborghini blueprints for R900! I could either spend money on one car or actually use the same money to buy ps4 games, almost everything on the game is expensive"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.ea.game.nfs14_row","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.game.nfs14_row&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Makeup Artist: Perfect Design","description":"Why not become a makeup artist?\r\n\r\nMake up with your style and pick your favorite match. \r\n\r\nYou can use foundation, eye makeup, lipstick, hairstyle, necklace and earrings to dress up.\r\n\r\nTons of different designs for you to discover, cloud, butterfly, rainbow, Christmas and Halloween, everything in trend can be an inspiration for your style.\r\n\r\nIn Makeup Artist:\r\n\r\n🤩 Use eye shadow brush to create beautiful gradient\r\n💄 Use lipstick to outline the perfect lip shape\r\n💇‍ Try different hairstyles and jewelries for your style\r\n\r\nCome and challenge your fashion skill now!","descriptionHTML":"Why not become a makeup artist?<br><br>Make up with your style and pick your favorite match. <br><br>You can use foundation, eye makeup, lipstick, hairstyle, necklace and earrings to dress up.<br><br>Tons of different designs for you to discover, cloud, butterfly, rainbow, Christmas and Halloween, everything in trend can be an inspiration for your style.<br><br>In Makeup Artist:<br><br>🤩 Use eye shadow brush to create beautiful gradient<br>💄 Use lipstick to outline the perfect lip shape<br>💇‍ Try different hairstyles and jewelries for your style<br><br>Come and challenge your fashion skill now!","summary":"Become a Stylist and challege your fashion skill now!","installs":"100,000+","minInstalls":100000,"maxInstalls":214948,"score":4.188679,"scoreText":"4.2","ratings":1059,"reviews":343,"histogram":{"1":129,"2":29,"3":59,"4":129,"5":709},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$9.99 - $29.99 per item","size":"91M","androidVersion":"5.0","androidVersionText":"5.0 and up","developer":"FunLanding Game Studio","developerId":"FunLanding+Game+Studio","developerEmail":"lindachan1127@gmail.com","developerWebsite":"http://www.yentstarco.com","privacyPolicy":"http://www.yentstarco.com","developerInternalID":"7220378925948075256","genre":"Simulation","genreId":"GAME_SIMULATION","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/44_ZZR2CtShJCOBEokPnVO1JZ13LtsfNL-PRRiL6xtYllCnagmR_h5MXVPq6LO4ermg","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/lfodNNmKji90GZKv7KUjvByU8IPw05oa_vqNExjCsGOGC4LR_4e4qHaFo-WXMHEVQw","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/gLukSPWvu4QGl-3ng-ITW-1A6x6t3jl3UfHd_31ShgOlgBKLtXRfsQ-Jx0Kb6zbpt_9c","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/BiT-2-ndlCzXA_y5PwIYnKUPyEO5AGYXtbNkNPb_f9G3wuQO-OJdjYJzCPWTvwydrFpv","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ZgTCi1Cf6FoK29pWiP0O2sq1dlLY_CCDgfDxWSlyoxiPLBR8lUs28JvoREnzdFomYLg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Mrfo9rX7PUWfbRyQphPTekQdqg06yEwnmHQf5vXZpGfIh7XX-TnCAqGC3xzrlkkqAT4k"],"contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Jun 16, 2021","updated":1628997241000,"version":"1.1.5","recentChanges":"Become a Stylist and challege your fashion skill now!","comments":["Yall I almost never leave reviews EVER and this game is super good! The graphics ate good quality and there are some times in the game where you can make your own choices of what to add to the makeup look! Not like those other makeup games you get bored of quickly.

You only really get them after finishing the makeup look.","This is a really good game, but there is a few things I don't like about it.nNumber one, it had SO many ads.

Annoying.Only download this app if you can deal with these things.","This game is fun and it is really cool but this game has way to much adds. To much adds to really play the game.

You can't go a full minute of game play without an ad, which is just too much. Ads don't usually bother me, but it makes the game frustrating, especially since some of the ads make the game freeze so you have to restart the app.","I love this!!! I paid for no ads and don't mind watching one or two here and there to get a few bonuses!!! It's highly addictive and I need new content cos I'm already at Age 33!!!!!!","Too expensive, too many ads. I begrudgingly paid to remove the forced ads, but it doesn't get rid off the ads you need to get a handful of energy, which of course runs out so quickly, in essence trying to force you to buy more gems to to get more gems. Definitely a pay to play, it would be fun if it actually let you play for free for more than 2 minutes.","It is a really fun game. But its almost unplayable with how many ads are in this gane. Everytime you do one of the missions (which is just simply merging something together and claiming the mission) you get an ad. So while i could have done 5 missions in 2 minutes i have to sit and watch an ad in between every one. So those 2 minutes turn into 7 minutes. At least make the ads a little less active. I uninstalled it from annoyance.","Ad hell. Get to age 1 and suddenly every time you turn something in a single merge or otherwise and you have an ad. And 4 dollars to basically even get to play this game which isnt eve great to begin with. It runs fine but the whole concept seems to be built around taking peoples money \"pop this bubble only 20 gems.\" \"You ran out of energy would lile like to refill?\" Doesnt feel much like a game. Just a quick cash grab. Damn mobile can be so disappointing."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"cc.lionstudios.mergelife","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.lionstudios.mergelife&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Bounce and collect","description":"In Bounce and collect you have to drop balls in the right place to collect the maximum and unlock the next challenge.\r\nEnjoy!","descriptionHTML":"In Bounce and collect you have to drop balls in the right place to collect the maximum and unlock the next challenge.<br>Enjoy!","summary":"More balls!!!","installs":"10,000,000+","minInstalls":10000000,"maxInstalls":14555340,"score":3.528399,"scoreText":"3.5","ratings":49450,"reviews":15468,"histogram":{"1":12673,"2":2759,"3":4159,"4":5480,"5":24377},"price":0,"free":true,"currency":"USD","priceText":"Free","offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$3.49 per item","size":"60M","androidVersion":"5.0","androidVersionText":"5.0 and up","developer":"VOODOO","developerId":"VOODOO","developerEmail":"support@voodoo.io","developerWebsite":"https://www.voodoo.io/","developerAddress":"4 rue Jules Lefebvre, 75009 Paris","privacyPolicy":"https://www.voodoo.io/privacy","developerInternalID":"8306041507631589049","genre":"Arcade","genreId":"GAME_ARCADE","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/P_TTxdRWAGyFJ1cYQxRK7hrbtDOpiO-ftCCyiB4d0Pk5OOySdlDT3GzVJNYFZW819w","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0YxbW3WhPvTwkcZiYiyhfbWVXGPPssOi4oiEZvKqIvqsnX8bm63BDpjb2TIO1vGVew","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/dZap-n8h7eX4KBFy37jYJZDzoT0OHxw13JWd_RHMdL5RYtMzfOirWzx0UXG66PMqTazw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/JJWyeziT2EYubJNle4uNCUAxdB4e6r13gv5OIoPkNPbPatOlNmrMCGOpKJa3eeVCJg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/tEDwkBHxvVz0MHOP5d4zPEVl8JrdnKy-K0ohoRXBrVnFKQx5fujGo7IsTYz9M1Scyrg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Sf46C8yxQCzoiJALmsjsjsFMQvoVBpxYbF2B_fh4L_jIzAiirdoMyn6dvryJ-xYBFwE","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rYmEcp07qZOaaMt-e-1HKlBWyBKKu3UK_3T7wxJqGUACnLr8fTsEC4AsobjFyGibpg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FD1kCQiFb8XVi13brhvoYrAngf1hY2FPaImDM-DZVvcTNplhQFjW-EWy-7-FFaFhzgM"],"video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ww-_iwe4PDc?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","videoImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0YxbW3WhPvTwkcZiYiyhfbWVXGPPssOi4oiEZvKqIvqsnX8bm63BDpjb2TIO1vGVew","contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":true,"released":"Apr 9, 2021","updated":1626889630000,"version":"2.0.4","recentChanges":"- Bug Fixes","comments":["Used to be a fun and relaxing game while still maintaining a modicum of strategy. Before the recent update. Now it's just frustrating. My last level, 443, I had 6,273 balls at the end of the first stage. Dropped them through a 2x AND 3x multiplier, and what did I end with? 2,009. That's not just broken; it makes you want to throw your phone in frustration when you're just trying to get a high score. CHANGE IT BACK!","good concept. problem is the ADS. Interupting the game, you watch an ad after each game. worst of all, the ads SLOW the app down to a point it's not longer able to be played. the \"high score\" list is absolutely BS. Play the game offline and the names still change. they are just random generated names. waste of time. --UNINSTALLED!","The game is a weird. For some reason you get stars when the stars do absolutely nothing. And the leader board is obviously full of not real people, and after a while (top 1000) you need to always get \"better than 99%\" to even move more than 2 spots. And for some reason after a while when the box is full the multipliers just stop working and the same with any special block. The game is fun but it gets really repetitive after about 4 hours of playing. This is a decent game If you like wasting time","It's a fun game overall, but once voodoo bought it, it just went downhill. It used to occasionally have ads ever few levels, but you could just turn off wifi to not see them. Now you are forced to play with internet or else you will literally not be able to do anything. All in all it's a fun game and worth a download, I just wish you weren't forced to use internet.","This game is the best but I have a couple of problems. First of all you are showing ads in the middle of the gameplay and I can't like concentrate and it's getting pretty annoying. The second problem I'm having is the lag and the freezing. When the balls are adding up a lot, it's a problem which causes the game to lag and bug a little bit. Even when I started playing the game, it freezes and idk why but please fix this mess right now or I'm uninstalling this app!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.dorotheebrondes.bounceandcollect","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dorotheebrondes.bounceandcollect&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Word Connect","description":"💕Do you enjoy the excitement of classic word games?

Been playing this game for over 4 years and it used to be my favorite game, but now it is my least liked game due to the ads and too many game competitions. It needs a feature that allows players to communicate with one another or the developer via chat or something similar for either questions, concerns, assistance, etc, not ads that take up more time than playing the game. Wish the developer would consider these changes. 07/21/21- too many ads!","Game is very challenging. Been playing for over 4 years. Love the various special activities. The badge tournaments are my favorite need more. Helps pass time. Was playing this game on a flight those near me wanted to know the name of the game. My husband loves it. Love the daily challenge events and other opportunities to earn coins. Need more time to view dictionary after last word.","Great game, lots of different words, never a dull moment. Keeps your brain in trim. The more levels you do the more obscure the words are. Well worth playing. Love the daily challenge. Always adding new levels, although some words are spelt the American way. Don't always get the Thanksgiving, St Patrick's Day, Halloween bonuses. Always good to play when you have a spare 10 or 30 minutes. Game spoilt by far too many adverts, most are over 30 seconds long and you get 3 adverts between each level","awesome, good brain activity, stimulates my mind, enjoyable, addictive good, fun loving, I love the new point system. The new challenges are super super fun. I love the theme challenges. 5 star game. The great challenges promises to be even more exciting. Thank you for the extra points for every season. Extra points all of the time. Seasonal games to play for extra points. I love the unexpected points. The Easter theme is very pretty. The themes are seasonal.i love it. Brain teaser.","Like the new version, I'm enjoy playing everyday ☺️ I see they have upgraded the game to make it more challenging, adding more on the daily challenge. There are too many advertisments, in this game, make me not want to play sometime. The advertisements are making the game not fun anymore TOO MANY ADS!

You have to wait forever to get a chance to try and get your money and of course you don't. Even the green boxes are rigged and the site never works right. I want my money. I down loaded it to make some money to help with my social security and instead I am fed up. What's worse is my son's saying we told you so.","Just a waste. The ads are ridiculous! You can't even trade the coins you collect for the gift cards in the store. The jackpot you supposedly collect you never win. You will get all but one puzzle piece to actually have a chance to win their bigger gift cards. You basically have to buy dice to keep going in the game. Lots of work needs to be done on this game. At least let the players spend the coins collected instead of them being dead. If we could do negative stars I would.","Game was fun got hacked in my face had a balance of 100.00 rolled looked up at my balance it went to 76.00 I'm always playing players with low atm balance. The revenge play no ad to load come back later...Then when I do play someone with a high ATM balance the game switches from that player or if you are lucky to get a ATM challenge you'll only get like 4 or 5 dollars out of their ATM Game is phony !! Wasted money and time never could cash out . Take the rest of my $ uninstalling!!","Game starts out nice but the close you get to rewards all of a sudden you start getting oops something went wrong and it keeps you from winning like the game up until that point and I was ready to cash out and then it does everything I can to keep you from it including let other people in to see you money I won on their crown game and it says your awarded I was awarded $60 and it still refuses to pay out it throws ads up when you're trying to win to try to disrupt you sucks"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.luckyday.dice","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.luckyday.dice&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"slither.io","description":"Play against other people online!

It's so fun and the controls are extremely easy to get used to... Two problems, though... The game lags if you don't have a really good connection on multiplayer, and me, being a person who mostly plays offline, asks you that the offline snakes be a BIT bigger? When you're playing offline and you get really big, all you can find is tiny snakes. The ones on the leader board aren't actually on the map. All I ask is that there be some bigger snakes on offline mode. Otherwise, perfect!","Would be a spectacular game if the owners weren't greedy and lazy. PC players have a massive advantage over mobile, able to zoom out their field of view. Blows my mind anyone would even play this on PC in the first place, but to each their own. Player controlled griefing bots are endless, merciless, and sap all joy from the game. I've had snakes go right through my body, straight to the head. Oh, sure, okay. This game is broke as hell. Was fun for like 20 hours. Bots ruined the whole experience.","It's fun..but.. It feels as if it's lacking somewhere. Perhaps if offered in the \"offline\", ai play, difficulty levels. Even though I play decently & play .io games,. A faster snake almost always gets me! I Want to play this game! Love the look of it, buttttttttt it gets annoying It's fun factor is short lived. 😕 I've prolly deleted about 5 times already. Few months later, try it again..🤗 then..oh it's still the same. Paper.io is better. I'll try again in 6 to 8 months ;)🤑","This is one of the best games ever, well done to the creaters! This is a very simple, easy-going and straightforward game. It is a bit laggy sometimes but that is fine. I would recommend this game to anyone. This is also a good time killer and I love how you can make your own skin. You can also do lots of skills in the game. To kill, I just stick my tail out, trap or rush into someone's face. I am now so good at this game and get 1st place sometimes. Right now, My highest score is 74,710.","I want to love the simplicity and mindless effort in this game, I really do. But every single time I have a good amount of time invested in a game and I'm at a good momentum building length, everything I'm looking at disappears and I'm left staring at the black back round. Every. Single. Time. Zero issues with my phone and internet. If my daughter plays on her phone or computer (she has the same phone), she has no issues.

I also feel like there should be a mute button to turn the music/hopping sound off","This game is a blast!!! Please more modes. I'm having so much fun with this game. Definitely one of the best ones yet. I understand the ads and it's Ok. More updates would be great. It is okay if you take your time. I'll be waiting because of all the levels. Great game overall. Out of 10. 9/10. And out of 5. Well. 5/5. Hope you read this have a wonderful day / night❤️","This app is amazing despite the ads!There are many levels to try and play. You can get stars by playing these and you can spend them on different balls! You can even get rewards and other things that can help you on your way to becoming a pro! Not only this , but the game itself is amazing and i have no doubts(except the amount of ads).And the best thing of this is how you can play offline and you don't have to worry!It is amazing and i definitely recommend this app!","Its fun game and i would get it again if i had nothing to do and i would give it five stars but theres a few things that bother me when playing, first of all the theres a pretty big delay when im clicking to move the ball im not sure if this is only for me or with others too, second there is no mute botton to mute the music in the game so i can't listen to music or things like that while playing.","Great game, (I've played this when it was not ad-based and now its shocking!) but I would like to share a few problems: 1. there should be a start from beginning button when you pause. 2. at least you should give like an ad in 3..2..1... since when I click on the screen and an ad pops out I've mistakenly clicked on the ad... 3. When you watch an ad to continue or unpause the game you should start little away from the obstacles.

Be sure to complete as many Season Goals as you can before the season ends!","comments":["this version is substantially worse than the 2017 version from EA. This doesn't control as precise. In offline games, if you choose out then your game is not saved. Lastly it takes way to long to load. This game came out in 1985, why does it take over 12 seconds to load? These devs would make a lot more money if they optimized such a simple game.","Play To Win microtransactions ruin an otherwise fun version of this game. The battle royale is so fun, but you can just pay for powerups that make you nearly unbeatable. The art, themes, avatars, challenges are fun, make it engaging and exciting to push for better. But microtransactions spoil the entire experience. A season pass is fair and fun, but pay to win microtransactions are inexcusable. Sad to see a great game taken advantage of in this way for profit.","I would rate this game 5 stars as I love it, I enjoy playing the royale mode and I love how each month they bring out a new season. However, I've rated it 3 stars because having to watch an ad before EVERY SINGLE game is completely ridiculous. It ruins the game, especially when you have to watch ads for the lucky box on top of that. The amount of ads makes me stop playing because I can't be bothered watching them before each game.","The gamelay itself is fine, it's just good old Tetris. However, the game has way too much ads, every start and end of a game you would get an ad, we get that you need the ad-revenue, but why every single game? The voluntary ads are acceptable as it's your choice to watch it, but was there really a need to spam ads every game? Another problem is the fact that the Tetris Royale mode is very Pay 2 Win. The game would be better if you fixed all of this.","Just an alright way to play Tetris. The game has touch controls by default and they're actually pretty good but it is way too easy to accidentally register drop downs when on default sens. There are on screen buttons which are better but again they feel too easy to clic. The contsnt updates are cool but there is an ad every new game which is really annoying and there is a SUBCRIPTION SERVICE TO REMOVE THEM. Plus no marathon mode unlocked at the start. Also of course there are microtransactions."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.n3twork.tetris","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.n3twork.tetris&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"FNF Mod Music Live","description":"FNF Music Live is a fun music simulation game.

But it's trash!!! Everywhere you click, you're being asked to pay for something. The 1st couple of days I loved the game. Then I started progressing and thing went downhill.. the hof is a joke. You should be able to stay in a higher legue if your deck isn't that great but the developers try to force you to upgrade your might with 100 different \"deals\". It has potential but it's definitely for pay to play players. And if you came here from a ad, that's not in the game.","This game is a cash grab. When you finally get past someone in the \"campaign\" you come to someone even harder. You can buy jewels to get better characters and level up, and you will have to do it again two characters later. Quit making it harder so that people have to pay to get past a certain point. Developing trust with your consumers works so much better. Make it to where you can get a decent amount of jewels for 0.99 or 1.99. Once I see anything over 4.99, I dont even bother with it.","Decently fun little game, but after spending a little money on it only to have the mighty pass benefits fade and have to pay again I've lost interest. Remove a lot of the Pay features and it would be a good game. If you've got money to burn its fun for that, but after losing the mighty pass and realizing virtually everything on it has to be renewed every month or so for the full amount just isn't worth keeping the game.","Very fun game at first but then it boring even after paying for upgrades the game got too hard and impossible to beat. Bit at first you got all the upgrades and leveled up really fast. Some of the gaming is hard to understand and not too much help is provided. I might play a little longer but giving up after a week. The great thing is that there is only in game ads and a lot of them but it beats watching a 30 second commercial like some other games. This game can have potential","It is a good game but after reading the comments and finding out myself that what you spend doesn't last was really disappointing. Can you imagine how much it cost to get to VIP7 and then find out its timed for 14 days..... Don't imagine because I'm very sad about it myself... what you pay for should be yours to keep. Especially if that money is a lot.

Zoning. Bug fixes.","comments":["The game has three notable things: 1. The easiness. You don't have to have skill to \"play\" it. 2. The bugs. From the infamous black screen to the ads that won't allow you to continue. 3. The numbers. Seeing numbers in the millions can be sorta satisfying, but that isn't enough. Not bad, especially because I love seeing massive numbers, but the bugs make it unbearable.","I don't usually give reviews of games, but this game, by far, has been the most infuriating thing I've tried to play. Not only does it crash before the game boots up often, but when it does work and you've finished a round, sometimes you're given an ad that you can't get out of. I don't mean you wait for it to finish, I mean nothing appears to get you out of the ad so you have to force stop the game and reboot it, restarting the infuriating cycle again. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!!!!!","Well then, what's my experience with this one? A fantastic once-in-a-lifetime game that is truly amazing at what it wants to achieve, or another ad-filled, unfair piece of mobile game garbage. Well, i wish i could answer this but yea, i'm one of the people in this crowd of reviewers that got the infamous black screen curse. The game gives me the voodoo logo and then just shows a black screen. When you then proceed to tap the screen, the game chrashes. So i really can't say anything about it. 😕","People! What has our world become! Everyone is complaining about some black screen when what they are waiting so long for is the real probem! The game is so bland! You just go up and down with a dodge. It is so obvious that they just ran out of ideas. The black screen isn't the problem, GO GET SOME IQ POINTS AND GET A GOOD GAME. And I just looked at the description and it says, AND I QUOTE \"bug fixes\" BUG FIXES! I don't know about you, but I ran into the black screen just like all of you!","Heard some pretty much negative reviews on this, but i got to say that i at least enjoyed it a bit. This game is just your basic flappy bird clone and stock market game. I find it enjoyable and satisfying that once you gotten towards the multipliers, you money increases rapidly. For the most part, this game isn't bad, but i wouldn't call it good for the most part as at the end of the day, it is still a bit bland."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gnarcade.doge","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gnarcade.doge&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Solitaire","description":"Solitaire by Tripledot Studios is the new best way to play the classic card game you know and love for FREE, offline and online!\r\n\r\nThe most popular card game in the world, classic Klondike Solitaire, also known as Patience, is a great way to relax and train your brain.

Only 3 stars because of rule changes over time. Examples are the options to deal 1 card at a time and shuffling the face down cards when out of moves. That would have been cheating. I uninstalled the game a number of times in disgust. I am 71; I guess younger people hate to lose. I use and enjoy it but if it had the old rules I would give a higher rating!","I enjoy solitaire and this app is definitely that. It's not aesthetically pleasing by any means but it plays. The games can be challenging too. I usually play it as a nightly ritual to help me sleep. This app works great, and I have no qualms with it.","It is a very fun very nice solitare game I love to play it. A plus is that it doesn't need wifi to be able to play it so it's nice for plane rides car trips etc. But one downfall is even though it says no ads it still had ads but it is still a good game so I recommend getting it to play.","Don't like the amount of time it takes between games also have to quite playing because you can't get rid of some stuff you don't want play. Will probably delete the game.","I have played a lot of solitaire games. I was playing one And there were so many ads I couldn't stand it and I Uninstalled it. It seems they all have Ads However, this one is not irritating and the deck is well shuffled.. On some of them I won so easily it didn't seem worth it to play. I highly recommend this solitaire game.

I shall continue to enjoy the game and do not wish to see any more types.I continue to enjoy your game, it is a challenge to keep moving. What is the top score come to?It is still a very entertaining game which offers a good challenge ( miss spelled ), age definitely has its draw backs.","Block Puzzle's a whole lot of fun to play+spend that extra time you have or when you're waiting for an appointment, etc.Not to mention it's a very challenging game 🎯 to play!!! I L ❤️VE playing this game!!! Vicky Wassn I just can't get enough of the game!!! It's a really \"GREAT\" game!!!","I loved the game when I used to play but now it seems like it won't even let me get up to 1000 points because they purposely rig the thing to give me shapes that are impossible to fit anywhere. I don't know if it's following an algorithm or what's going on but its pretty annoying. Maybe they don't want me to play the game anymore. Idk.","I am very good at playing this puzzle game but the higher you get the more rigged it is you go to move a piece and it just automatically pulls it back so I don't recommend this game at all it is rigged. They really need to fix that bug in the game did it's not cool! This game is not worth your time because the higher up you get in the points the more they started rigging it you try to move a piece and they snatch it back don't even waste your time!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.dxm.nopuzzle","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dxm.nopuzzle&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Stealth Master - Assassin Ninja Game","description":"Are you a good ninja?\r\n\r\nHave you only learned about these mysterious martial arts from ancient Japanese legends?

Dont play this if you dont want to pay money as they very rarely give you the things you need to make the shops etc open, so your town takes ages to expand. Although if you buy the golden ticket they give you a lot more which helps your town. But I'm not someone who plays the mini games much and don't like that in the golden ticket you have to play them to get the points.

The only problem is that the special decorations for events, that we used to buy with Township Cash, doesn't appear any more (maybe in our region I don't know) Please fix it. There's no special decorations anymore so the game is getting boring. There's nothing to do with the Cash right now.. Thank you","Customer service has ignored me for quite some time.

I'll update this review if I ever hear from their customer support. Update: Support is a joke! They said they would give 25 points for a glitch & it never happened.

You have to watch ads to get the songs. Watch ads to continue after finishing or hitting the wrong color in a song. Like I said the game overall is hard but fun. I'd recommend this to anybody who likes upbeat songs and are okay with ads.","I got this app like 2 hours ago and at first it kind if fun, but after 20 minutes it gets boring.There are adds before you start every round and when you finish every round. And it gets really annoying. I do not recommend this game. You should not play it, its really bad. I have to 2 stars for the first 20 minutes were it was fun. DO NOT download this app. IT IS SO BAD. Sorry but the truth has to be said.","This game is very entertaining! You can play challenging, fun rounds, and listen to trendy music. There isn't a bunch of advertisements, and the game usually runs fast, with minimum lagginess. I recommend!","You can watch an ad to continue the game, but what they don't tell you is if you choose not to you have to watch one anyway. You have to watch ads to access songs. This app is completely a Cash grab in my opinion.","I really really love this. It's too much of adds buy this game is a dope qnd it makes sense. I really wish you will update more songs coz I really fell in love with this game.

The reason I gave it only 3 stars is due to the fact that everytime you won a game, you would only level up by 5pts which made it so that it would take you a long time to get to the end to 140pts. But, if you put that aside, it is quite a good and well made game. You are able to customise to a certain degree and it has daily challenges too.","This game is not realistic but it is still enjoyable. By using the joker and undo, it seems every deal has a solution. The challenge is finding the solution. I currently have a 100 game win streak. UPDATE: Downgraded to one star. You have to view an ad to get a joker but THE AD NEVER ENDS! The irony is that it is an ad for another Solitaire game.","The deck is stacked. I just installed this earlier today. I noticed that I was winning most of the games. I asked the vendor about it and was told that the game deliberately gives you winnable deals. It doesn't tell you that, and it doesn't give you an option play random deals. If that's what you want, this might be the app for you, but it's not for me.","Game is only good for about 2 days of playing, because after that, it bugs you with constant ads (scam alert) and advertising false ads that lie about games for you to download and waste your money on, just for you to download more games to continue more advertisements, interruptingore game play, and taking up your time and dollars. Eventually it gets to the point where this game gets rigged to where you can only play by using the joker card, after running out of plays (rigged).","You get a lot of unsolvable decks while doing freeplay. I feel like it's their way of pushing ads. But if you turn off wifi you can skip the ads. However, that's when you notice they give you more than the average rate of unsolvable decks and what would be a whole lot of ads if your wifi was on.😔"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"solitaire.patience.card.games.klondike.free","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=solitaire.patience.card.games.klondike.free&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Hungry Shark Evolution - Offline survival game","description":"We're the Official game for Shark Week - live every week like it's Shark Week!\r\n\r\nTake control of a very Hungry Shark and go on a frantic ocean rampage, surviving as long as possible by eating everything and everyone in your way!

Glad I can play it online or offline. Just a note for the people in the advertising department or whatever you may call yourselves... Whenever I am given a chance to watch an ad for monetary value on the game... Almost every time im willing to watch the ad. Also, I feel like the tips go away way too quickly to read. Good job everyone, this game is great. Just wish I could get to the giant creatures faster lol","love this game, it's def one of my faves & the amount of time I spend playing it just speaks for itself. but recently I've been getting really frustrated w/ it. Everytime I spend more than 20 min playing it & if I die of starvation, the game freezes. it doesn't let me apply no action other than exiting. all the gold, gems and points I've made simply go to waste, let alone MY TIME. please, help me fix it. I've already deleted & downloaded again and nothing changes. l'll be waiting for a feedback.","The game is an amazing game that as a kid I used to play so much, it's entertaining and shiny easy to catch a child's eye. Though this game is directed towards a younger audience, I recommend making the map bigger or just making a new map you can access in general. There's minimal adds, and it's not laggy at all. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because the play area is much to tiny for a sandbox survival game.","The game is fun and it's one I used to play a lot as a kid, but recently I redownload it and the game has just gotten way out of hand. The creator of the game could have spent time making the map bigger but instead made sharks that breathe fire and other crazy things like it, and you can't survive them unless you have the same shark or one bigger.","Nice job taking our gems! Helicopters, special sharks/humans, hang gliders and boats dont give gems anymore. The newest shark stalls before every boost making it garbage to use. This game is going downhill fast... edit... they give gems still but at a 85% decreased rate. Before I could get over 20 gems a game. Now im lucky to get 5.

The game isn't even that cool.","Much better than most. Offers variety with mini-games. Ads (ugh!) don't interrupt game play. Good graphics. Can turn off music. Decent instructions. A carefully designed app. Minus 1 star for content of some ads.","There were so many ads, that (for the first time) I paid for no ads, but there are still ads plus the timer runs out faster so you have to watch even more ads.

UNO Universe&#39;s trip to Japan will open the second map—Osaka!—on August 1. New challenges, new rewards, and new accessories are waiting for you! <br>2. The achievement feature has been revised. Lots of new content waiting for you to explore!<br>3. Season 9 of Ranked Mode will start on July 24. A Midsummer&#39;s Dream theme decorations will be added. <br>4. There are new contests in the UNO Cup, and the water pipe theme awards have been updated.","comments":["This games cheats you when you loose stars. It starts you off at Zero points when you loose a star. Making you purchase star defense if do not want to lose stars. Oh and you need to purchase rank defense too. Statistically it would be impossible to reach levels above platinum without purchasing these two options. Careful not to get caught in this pay to win scheme. And to the devs, stop robbing the points and the stars. Starting us off at Zero points when loosing a star is cheating us!","My opinion kind of reflects that of others in the review. I had initially given it a 5 star. The game interface was really good, still is. But the way they have designed the game deliberately to just force players to pay money is sick. You can't play without coins, and u always end up losing more than you win, especially with VIP and all that. You can't play even 5 games continuously, if you are not ready to pay. Please, I'll rather buy cards from a store and play friends when we get together.","This used to be my go-to relaxation game. Now it's just a joke. I firmly believe that over 85% of the \"players\" are computers and that winning a game is something one can only wish for. I started off the middle of last month with over 14,000 coins; now I have 0 because no matter how hard I try, there is no possible way to win a game. You have to buy coins and/or diamonds to get ahead. You can't just play & have a nice relaxing time without spending money.","Great game and way to play with friends to pass time. However when it says there is an update I go to the market and there is no update so I'm caught in a vicious loop and can't play. Last time it did this I lost my profile and had to start over and the developer did nothing to help me retrieve my account. I will change this comment once the problem is fixed.","This app is fun when you first start. Once you've had it for longer, it becomes less enjoyable and rigged.

This version includes minor improvements and bug fixes.","comments":["Have it on VR, console and mobile. It's my favourite game, and is a great way to make friends. There is a lot there for the art community and also people who enjoy the creative aspects such as making games. My only complaint is that the rec room community aren't pushed enough to make a variety of games, and lots of people only make ones they know are popular such as parkour and pvp's. Rec room needs to find a way to encourage more people to create a wider variety of games","This game is amazing! It's almost as good as vrchat! Very good work on this! Although..I do wish they added hair physics or shaders or just something to really improve recroom like maybe give the player's bodies so they can have more experience? But the hard thing is using the full body morphs. They're hard and complicated but still good!","I would give it 5 stars but the only thing I personally don't like is the new home, loading screen colors and background colors for items. I liked the purple color on the loading screen and I think on the background of items too. The new home is way to bright, it needs to be a bit darker. But overall a very good game. And maybe they should allow junior accounts to make worlds but maybe no be able to share or the game restricts the account to certain items that are inappropriate.","At first when the game first released on Android it was pretty buggy. Controls were off and it was just stuttering every minute. But now with some recent updates it's gotten a whole lot better. There are still some stutters but honestly those are also on the PS4 and Xbox versions of the game as well so I don't know if they can fix it. Paintball for example depending on the map used to be unplayable at times. Now it's pretty alright. Definitely playable on all maps now. It's a damn fine port.","The game is good so far. I wanna play it with my friends but it doesnt support their version. I suggest more graphics settings like frame rates and stuff because my fps awlays drops to 40 and Im sure that I can run this game stable 60 fps. Also have some control issues hope you can fix it. overall game is good it brings mobile to another level"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.AgainstGravity.RecRoom","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AgainstGravity.RecRoom&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Hill Climb Racing","description":"Play the original classic Hill Climb Racing!

But the reason to Give this GAME 3 stars is that , while playing this game every 2 or 3 mins the ad is poped up because of this I died many times I lost all the things like sword , pickaxe and more... Another thing is that please add Multiplayer mode in it, it's too booring just playing alone😫...Other than these two problems everything is Very Good.","This game is trash, I do not recommend this game. It is filled with ads and commercial breaks? Although the game is a bit like Minecraft but not much.

It does get annoying trying to win the hard, and super hard levels, but you can still win those levels without paying money. Its a game, and games are not supposed to be easy, and fast to complete. The $4.99 for gold pass is not expensive. I never had any problems with bugs, and annoying ads. The developers do deserve to make money from the hard work of development. I'm a developer, so I understand the time consuming, and hard work learning, and writting code.","Be prepared to spend money in order to complete hard levels because the amount of chances you get, without lightning and bombs etc, forces you to purchase these in order to move on to the next level. No choice of levels and once your lives are used up on harder levels, you have to wait, sometimes half an hour, until the lives reload or you can purchase more lives. This game EATS your money!!","Level 114 seems to have no chance at being completed without purchasing items. After viewing several videos on YouTube I observed the only ones that had beaten this level had the unfair advantage of starting off with additional moves. Pay close attention to this detail as it is exactly how you get caught up in buying. Could have been great, but is a ripoff.. Avoid this game.","The mini games are the fun part. The \"Bejeweled\" aspect of the game is old hat and not particularly fun. In order to complete a difficult level you must leave the game and come back in about 15 minutes - which is so bizarre - or pay real money to buy tools to help you beat the level. Very disappointing. I just want to play the mini games.","this game is fantastic fun. perfect balance of challenge and creative fun with your winnings, best game ever! some super updates released today! the special themed events are a real treat. gorgeous graphic images...what a treat. it's getting more and more challenging which slows down progress through the levels, but I still love it. The game keeps coming up with super cute seasonal themes. Awesome! It's been tough at the higher levels. The team interactions are superb. Loving it for over a year"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.playrix.fishdomdd.gplay","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playrix.fishdomdd.gplay&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Hide 'N Seek!","description":"The good old classic hide & seek.

Just enjoy the game💜😊","Ya, so much ads. But I can understand this because y'all want to earn money. The main problem I think of this game is REPETITION.

A bit unrealistic, because you can score from the weirdest angles (physics like \"am i a joke to you?\"), but still enjoyable. Customization is lacking content, and there aren't any things to do except the playing in the field, but that's ok. Achievements would be great. All in all a great game, try it out! P.S.: I like it more than the rivals, it's less frustrating, you can get back the ball and try again without reloading.","Gameplay 5*. BUT! The static ads at the bottom are not enough, and that you are pushing ads after every goal or failed game is a BIG no for me and this game... I wanted to give it a try, but I watched more ads in this game for past few days then in 50 other games combined where you can watch ads for rewards. And I'm not talking about rewards in this game, but random ads after each try. If you keep ads to just the bottom ad, or one ad after few games played, I will consider raising the rating.","Played game on my son's ipad enjoyed it. Decided to download on my android to play and all that has happened is that I have been bombarded with ads literally after each single play an ad. I played over an hour on the ipad with no ads. Very very disappointing, just uninstalled and moving on.","Far too many ads, even during Gameplay. Also there is no challenge to it. Score an easy goal and then game over, move on. Too repetitive and dull.","This is a very nice game. I have suggestion. Each match ... give us 4 simulation of play. If we make 2 succeed and 2 failed, the final score shoulde be 2-2. If we make 3 failed and 1 succeed, the we lose 1-3.

","comments":["Been playing for about a year now. 1st, if the game doesn't want you to win you won't win. I rarely play Kingdom as it seems very rigged - I rarely get pitched against weaker opponents, particularly on promotion games. Once you get above about Stage 11/12 Arena is almost impossible - I'm guessing there comes a point where it gets easier again but I have L4 Bat and L3 others and can't get close. If, like me, you don't take it seriously and accept the dubious algorithms then this game is okay.","Game was fun to start with but boring now. 90% of gamers end in draw which means in the playoff it just comes to who can hit the ball further, which means whoever has the strongest club. There's no skill in that. Also it's almost impossible to miss a putt so you already know it's going to be a draw if you both get it on the green in same amount of shots.","Hey your Ruins challenge is really stupid. It's extra difficult and doesn't let us get necessary coins. What's the point in giving us a tournament if we can't get a decent score and have to leave it halfway? Now the review: This game is unfair because someone with a lot of money will buy a bat wing level 5 and beat you in 2 shots if you can't afford to pay these gyus. That's just ridiculous. The UI and UX is excellent. I like the stages too. But the challenges are really unfair...","It is and extremely fun game and challenging which makes it even more fun I do love the game play with other opponents. But they need to fix the rules on out of bounds and water hazards. It does not count a stroke for out-of-bounds or two strokes for water hazard which I find very frustrating when your opponent beat you after hitting it in the water","Nice game to pass the time. Only downside is when there is a competition against other players for better prizes, you might get paired up against someone who has 2-4 times the amount of trophies as you and their clubs are by far better because of it. You basically have no chance when that happens. If they fixed that aspect, I would definitely increase my rating."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.sports.real.golf.rival.online","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sports.real.golf.rival.online&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Hair Dye","description":"Are you up for the best hair challenge ever?

Downloaded after seeing the horrible ad it had. Not only that the ad also tricked me thinking that I need to make a shape without lifting my finger to a Ball Sort Puzzle... like what? And after downloading, got like a trillion number of Ads. Was going to rate 0 stars if the play store actually let me.","The reviews express my same feelings. In the beginner level, I enjoy how my brain is challenged. However, the number and lengths have me going back to many of the Google games and others where there are ways of reducing the length and number of ads. Forcing me to watch ads of no interest to me for more than a quarter of a minute and repetittion makes even more disinterested in what's being sold. At 72 years of age, I know how to look for a product I'm interested. The rest is a waste.","The game is fine, what's not fine is the endless loop of trying to get you to install other games between every game. It displays the game they want you to install and when you use the close (x) at the top it takes you to the app store to download it and you're stuck doing this at least three times no matter how you try to get back to the game. Uninstalled.","I love this game! It's fun, it's simple, and relaxing. After a long bad day I play it and then wind down and relax. I reccomend it to everyone. 😀","It did work great. Then last week it started glitching when you hit 1up for an extra vial. It runs a wheel like it's processing, never goes to the ad and returns to the game without giving you an extra vial. So I uninstalled and reinstalled and it's starting me at level 1.

Easier to Uninstall and play another game. I might have paid for no ads, but no option. Thanks anyway. UPDATE... As you can see, they address WHY they have to have ads but not that the ads stick open requiring a restart after each game. Therefore, I will not reinstall until reviews show it's fixed.","This game is very confusing. There is no clear path towards goals, as in you work on several areas without knowing how many levels are in an area to pass. It is confusing and jumps from being easy to overly difficult, where literally 20 attempts must be made to pass a level. I don't recommend this at all.","Really great game. But requires you to make purchases to go to higher levels. And it's not exactly cheap. Another downside to the game are the rewards that basically goes to waste unless you can play 24/7. There should be an option to choose when to use the rewards and not just automatically when recieved. Or at least be in sync with when you are logged in to the game.","Great game. All you bored geniuses should be busy developing that game with no ads, that gives you unlimited lives, and pays people to play. Or...you could just shut the hell up and delete the game if it's annoying you so much. It's a game! Get it? For those that know it's for entertainment, it's got great graphics and the developers have put much effort into it. Download it. You'll enjoy it.","I like others, must complain about your not allowing us to play and finish a game without paying. We get to the last play and we are out of moves. I am going to finish these last games and take the game off my phone. I truly am going to miss the game. As developers you might consider the people that play and enjoy it.

This game will waste all your data if your not using wifi. Also it will drain your battery fast. Doesn't give any rewards, only the tokens to play bingo. And it will stay at 49.5 points or reset back to 0 before it can reach 50 points on the rewards. Theres also a dating video ad called uDates when click to install it will redirect to a totally different ad.","I had playing for 2.5 seconds until the first add popped up. I literally watched 10 adds in one single game of bingo? And you click on just claim and not the double up option and STILL have to watch an add?! I swear I just played this for 2 hours and I can't take the adds anymore with all those fake ppl promising 3000 dollars in an hour and a half its obviously not true but for YOUR apps sake.... you gotta cut back on the adds. Just play them between games like every other app.","All I have to say is .......... How do they get away with these false advertisements. They are without a doubt false. People file class action suits against companies for unbelievable reasons. There was a guy who filed suit against Subway Sandwich shop because when he went home and measured the sandwich it wasn't a foot like they advertise. Can we not somehow all get together and file suit on these companies. Everyone of them are lies","The only game i have got to finish is the first one. At about the middle of the game or towards the end it throws me out of the game or just shows a black screen, that starts the app over when you tap on the screen. I dont know why i keep falling for these bull$h1t apps. All the fake apps description should read, play our app, you will get real close to cashing out, but the money will be cut down so much you will delete the app before you get there. Sucker, or something like that.","If I could give this game zero stars I would. Don't bother downloading it. Total waste of time. Gets you close to winning cash, or any prize for that matter, then it just completely takes away the cash prizes. All I needed was 62 cents to cash out, but it completely stopped all cash prizes when I got so close.
