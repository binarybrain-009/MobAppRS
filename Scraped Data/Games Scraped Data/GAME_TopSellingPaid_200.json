It's like the devs are trying to con us into subscribing onto the Realms service. It's impossible to play multiplayer with xbox accounts, you can only play local, server, or Realms. I still rate it 3 because fortunately, there's no visible bug to me that affects singleplayer gameplay. I'm just very dissapointed.","its amazing when it actually works, at the current moment its deciding to not connect to the internet and say i have bad wifi, when i actually dont. i cant play with my friends, i can't play at all. it doesn't say its offline it just loads continuously then says check your network connection 🙄. pls fix this or give me advice or something","Absolutely loved playing the game with great friends. We built an amazing collection of villages and pathways between them in the Nether. However this morning we logged on and massive chunks of the map had disappeared and out inventory and start point reset. It has took us months of working together to build this, and to see it ruined in an instant has been very upsetting. If anyone says it's just a game, you are wrong. <3","The game is great but I can't connect to marketplace even though I have Internet, also I suggest the the combat should improve coz the tools feel all the same in terms of fighting and the axe should disable shields just like in java, I also want to put banners on my shield and dual wield and add a bit more sounds to the doors and trapdoor for a cooler and more diverse gameplay and I hope that the upcoming updates would add more features to both bedrock and java equally.","The game quite good and always have a lot of surprise for me to uncover it...the new update is awesome now i have much more animal to collect as pet but literally I have 1 problem... I'm hoping dev will add up in game voice communication so that i don't need to use third party apps to talk with my friend.

Very respectful of your time and rewards you well for just playing. There are pay to win microtransactions, but they aren't necessary, and as I mentioned, the game is very rewarding without any purchases. I've sunk well over 200 hours into this game and it's always a joy to play. Ninja kiwi is constantly updating the game with new features and it's mind blowing to see the progress between Bloons 1 and Bloons 6","A brilliant tower defence game. It features great balance, heaps of missions, huge variety of tower upgrade options. There are lots viable strategies and I often find myself trying different combinations of towers to achieve a bloons victory. Lots of updates as well and pretty much no microtransactions. There is no pay to play aspect. This is a high quality, well polished game where it seems the developers are interested in crafting a fun game for all, not a cash grab.","I love the game its one of my most favorite!!! Tower defense games I've ever played!!Gotta admit it's awesome!!!even with it being really hard to get past like the levels after 100 it's still fun to just collect all the medals and I love the super monkey🐒 I feel like it's a little toooooooooooooo OP tho but that probably just to help us on harder levels besides I love it!","I've played btd5 and blooms monkey city a lot and to find out they had a knew one in 3d with monkeys a new upgrade path and tier 5 upgrades I was just like \" wow \", new edit: still play the game, it's a great game, still love, 1 teeny tiny problem tho, I can't change my name, I accidentally left it as player and can't change it, maybe add that feature? Thanks","Out of all the Bloons TD games, this one has to be the best. I love the new update and am hoping for more paragon towers, and maybe a new tower. The frequent updates make the game even better, with changed game mechanics.

Even though there are many glitches (especially on mobile, which more than half of the geometry dash community is playing on), it is still a great time-killer. But updates take waaaay too long, especially for 2.2. Four freaking years should have been enough for a little update.","This game is pretty good thanks to the developers and I play it almost every day, there's hidden secrets and different ways to unlock characters and get orbs, plus, don't forget the best part, where you can become a level maker and get fun out of that, but I wouldn't play this game if you rage easily. This is an exciting action packed game with cool skins and lots of stuff to explore, the $2 to get it is well worth your time and money, I've been playing the geometry dash world for 4 years. 👍","Amazing game! Even tho this is a rhythm game, Friday Night Funkin' just kind of took its spotlight but the music's still pretty cool! There's a variety of pre-made levels to play (Stereo Madness - Fingerdash) I like to call it the main story line. It dosen't even stop at the pre-made levels! There's also a level editor so you can play other people's levels and make your own! This definitely isn't for people who rage-quit easily tho. This game is quite good!","Hard but fun. You'll most likely get frustrated or annoyed of the game but the music is banger and the maps look nice. I think there's a problem with my daily login chests because whenever they are opening and I try to open them it usually says \"something went wrong\" and then I can't open the chests but I still get the countdown again. This isn't that much of a problem for me but it's just something I wanted to mention. There could be something wrong with my internet or account but Idk.","I've been playing geometry dash for 3 years now, and it's by far one of the most creative games in all of history. You obviously need practice to make good levels, but when someone does they can be insanely incredible. (Check out the level how, needs a very good device but it's insane!) Not to mention, it's actually helped me with anger issues, rather than increase them. Most people rage at this game and then never play it again, just remember it's a game and you'll be fine!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.robtopx.geometryjump","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.robtopx.geometryjump&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Monopoly - Board game classic about real-estate!","description":"Roll the dice, buy, sell, build and scheme your way to become a rich landlord in MONOPOLY!

We&#39;ve made some improvements to the game:<br><br>- We&#39;ve made improvements to all multiplayer modes<br>- We&#39;ve updated the visuals in the game","comments":["This is a very fun game and is enjoyable. I love the multiplayer and online features. However, I haven't won a game on single player. I once owned the whole board except for the yellow color group, blue color group, and all the railroads. The computer would never land on any of my properties but I'd always land on its properties. The game is not fair and I wouldn't recommend it.","Fun at first but the AI let you get away with tactics that would never work in real life. Begin the game by offering double what properties are worth in trades until you have one of each colour. Refuse all trades, build up cash and the AI will let you buy anything even to the point where you own every property. It makes the game too easy even on hard difficulty. Also there's a lot of locked stuff I was hoping to unlock by playing but looks like you have to pay for it which is disappointing.","The game is pretty well-crafted and beautifully designed. The vs AI mode lives by its name, \"monopoly\", not \"by mere chance\". Once I got the right mindset that \"all odds may work against you\" (even the dice, the cards, trading 'conspiracies', and combination of all those) the game starts swaying towards you. Rather just throw the dice and rely on \"luck\", the game rewards you by actively manipulating the odds and take calculated risks. I beat the hard mode almost everytime. Well done.","The dice in this game are terrible. One game it had me land in jail 5 times (including 3 in a row) and another game I had tax collected 3 times in a row. The other issue is the predictable auction. You always pay at least $10 over value if you want to win. Overall, not a bad game except for the dice.","Great app. Easy to use and fun. I love that you can adapt the rules slightly when you want a quick game against the computer. For example, skip past the community chest cards and a property must be bought or auctioned when landed on. The downside is, initially you have to pay for the app, you only get the basic board and pieces. Therefore if you want different you will have to pay even more to get those items. Also, I think you should offer the themed boards and pieces- such as Harry Potter🙂."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.marmalade.monopoly","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marmalade.monopoly&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Stardew Valley","description":"ConcernedApe's smash hit farming RPG comes to Mobile!\r\n\r\nMove to the countryside, and cultivate a new life in this award-winning open-ended farming RPG!

It is so relaxing for farming type game. You can do so much things while waiting for your crops to grow such as mining, fighting monster in dungeon, foraging, fishing and develop friendships with the villagers. It is my favorite game so far. However, the game takes so long to update and we're missing some of the feature that already exist in other device platforms like Ginger Island and Multiplayer mode. I will surely change my rate if developers will update it soon. TY","Amazing, fun, and relaxing! I love all the gameplay you get. The unlimited possibilities with this game are great! I could play this forever and its worth buying. The only downside is that the game sometimes completely blacks out the screen and freezes up you lose a whole day or even a few days. Please fix this other than that the game is fine.","If I could rate 6 stars I would! This game is my go to on a stressful day. From the charismatic character personas, to the 2d nostalgic graphics, it is a lovely way to relax and unwind! Would recommend especially for younger kids. If they have a basic understanding of how to use mobile games, and to understand the energy bar, they will really enjoy it!","Love the game, I'd give 5 stars but the problem is the game freezes 50% of the time whenever there is a friendship cutscene, and I actually mean it when I say 50%. Most of the time I can skip the scene still and then continue playing but I want to see the scenes, but this last time it froze the skip button wasn't there either, so I had to close out of the game. You guys should fix this bug. It happens a LOT when these cutscenes happen, and it would be nice to just watch them as intended.","I absolutely love this game. Seriously, it's worth it, the money and the app. There's no problems whatsoever. It shows you how life is like on a farm and you get to experience that as well. To describe my experience in 5 words I would say: calming, soothing,fun, relaxing and enjoyable. You are able to build the farm of your dreams.On my multiplayer farm (on PC)we got the OWL STATUE,the rarest thing in the game in the 1st year and again on the 2nd year!!WHAT ARE THE CHANCES??!!!"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.chucklefish.stardewvalley","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chucklefish.stardewvalley&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Terraria","description":"DIG!

I've been a long time fan. I have had it for Xbox 360, PS4, Nintendo 3DS, and mobile. The reason for only 4 stars, however, is the fact that the mobile version does not get updated close enough to the PC version, and this effects who I can play with in a major way. If I could give 4.75 stars I would, but yeah, I wish it would recieve updates quicker.","Perfect All-In-One sandbox game. Massive fan and have been for 7 years. I'm happy to have spent 5$ on this. Controls however weren't great. Older ones were better. But I can just use a controller and problem solved...The game has much more detail and clarity that I never regret putting any hour into this game. Would highly recommend...Although I'd advise to play with an external controller.","The controls are very strange but can be mapped to fit your needs, and what I binded to mine seemes to be natural. The game starts you off weak, but can go mining, fishing, building, exploring, fighting, to get stronger, and as you defeat the bosses, you find how the longer you spend doing each of these things, the stronger you become. Once you think your getting overpowered, you go to the next area of the game, and it feels like your back to square one. which is not a bad thing at all. 10/10","Incredible game. Lots of love and attention has clearly been invested into its development. Great progression and rewarding difficulty and the freedom to do pretty much whatever you want. The controls feel very smooth and intuitive considering it's the mobile version. Definitely worth the buy. I've done nearly 7 full playthroughs across all the platforms and each time feels like a completely new experience. Terraria is a timeless masterpiece.","Terraria is an absolute masterpiece. It has a wide variety of items, and bosses. However, when you finally beat the game, there is a deep hole inside you that just feels like something is missing. And this hole can never be filled, no matter how many times you play the game over. Terraria is a timeless, one round masterpiece.

I've played a couple hundred hours on my computer, and finally had to buy it for mobile so that I could play on the go. There is one slight issue, though: when I switch to another app to do something else (check emails, turn on Spotify, etc.) it will occasionally totally forget the current run. There's no longer a continue prompt, and the run isn't in the run history. I'm unsure if this is an issue with the game or my phone, but it's the only issue I've experiened","I read the reviews about the game not properly saving your runs or the controls being wack, but I loved this game so much on PC and Switch that I decided to go for it anyways and hope those issues would be fixed later. I must say, I have not had a single issue with this port whatsoever. The controls might be a tad wonky at first but it's not hard to figure them out. I have also never lost a save. To be fair, I have only been playing for 2 days but still. This is a great game and worth the price","Slay the Spire is one of my favorite games of all time. That said the port has some issues. These are the major ones. 1. The app 'losing' runs when you close midgame and randomly finding them again several games later 2. The app occasionally not recognizing when you beat an Ascension level. This has happened to me at least 3 times, including my first time beating Asc 19, which was very frustrating. 3. it is very difficult to deselect cards or potions if you decide you no longer wish to use them","I want to rate this better. I really do. But it's so frustrating when the game doesn't save your progress. Sometimes I only have time to play a few floors. The game data says it's saved, but when I open the app back up my game is no longer there and I have to start a new one. Why say \"game saved\" when that feature only works 25% of the time?","Fun but not complete. It's a copy and paste to andoid from PC. So if you play it on PC first you understand that somethings needs to be revamped to function on a phone. The issue I ran into the most is the potion would glitch out and not do its effects when use. There's other small stuff that glitches too. If they fix that, the game would be 5 stars for sure!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.humble.SlayTheSpire","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.humble.SlayTheSpire&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas","description":"Five years ago, Carl Johnson escaped from the pressures of life in Los Santos, San Andreas, a city tearing itself apart with gang trouble, drugs and corruption.

The controls work fairly well although quick weapon selection isn't convenient. The graphics looked to have been updated with better lighting, shadows and reflections. However, a HUGE fatal flaw that potential buyers should beware: as of a recent Android update a couple months ago the game no longer works, and immediately crashes back to home screen upon running game. Asof this review, the bug is under review but no fix yet.","This game was good at first...Been playing it for years and always had the crashing problem no matter what type of phone I'm on. IPhone, Samsung, etc. Doesn't matter. It crashes after a certain amount of time. Only had it for 3 days...I always make it so far in missions just for it to stop working. I doubt I will get a response, but fix it please...Tired of buying it over and over just for it to crash and stop working after doing missions over and over and getting far in the game. Its annoying.","Well this game is an fun game over all, but there is some glitches that I think they should fix. Espically the camera glitch. I spawn in the game and my camera is all over the place and I have no control of it. I can't see where Im going or doing. I don't know if its just me or its the game itself.","Terrible. I have a Samsung S21 5g and downloaded the app without issue however it forced close upon trying to open it. This problem continued until requested a refund. I then attempted to give it another shot in hopes of doing a couple of software updates, believing that may be the issue. However, the problem persisted. Also they would not allow a second refund, since I put my faith in the Google play store. I will never make this mistake again. !!! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS APP IT'S A SCAM!!!","This is fun and all but just like everyone else it stopped opening and immediately force closes. For me it was after I updated my tablet so I'm hoping there just needs to be an update so the software matches. UPDATE: I don't know if there will ever be one which is really sad because it means I have to start all my progress over by trying to Uninstall then reinstall, pretty upsetting that so many people are having this issue and there's no fix for it"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.rockstargames.gtasa","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rockstargames.gtasa&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"DraStic DS Emulator","description":"DraStic is a fast Nintendo DS emulator for Android.

No ads, good frame rate. Controls are a little annoying sometimes but it's the best you can do for mobile I guess, so I connected it to my PS4 controller and works fine, the only problem with that is that the ABX and Y buttons don't have a bind for my controller meaning I can't use those buttons. I would really appreciate if this was fixed in the future.","Pretty great emulator, no ads (as expected), runs smoothly, and so far no issues besides the usage of mic. If you don't have to use a microphone for what you want to play, then you're good to go. This emulator offers great customization/mapping for both portrait and landscape modes. It doesn't include any multiplayer options, however that should be expected for an emulator. It even offers its own cheats for some roms which can be fun to play with. This is by far the best DS emulator for Android.","The emulation per se works nigh flawlessly, but the \"load new game\" option has started to cause some problems by failing to autodetect the folder and locking me out of navigating through folders.It gets stuck on \"/storage\", where there's only a \"..\" item that does nothing. Highly annoying issue. It should just let me pick a fixed folder (and start the explorer at /storage/0/emulated) instead of trying to autodetect everytime.","Really good emulator. Everything is smooth and runs good. I use the Myboy series but they don't have a DS so this is good. One problem. The multiplayer/wifi system needs to be added. As a pokemon player, it would be great to trade between game files. As an advance wars player, it would be great to fight against my friends. Certainly could use that. I quite literally say this would be perfect with the connectivity, there is nothing else I could say for improvement.","I love this app, but, I uninstalled it and downloaded it again just now but now, it won't let me go through my phone to find games. When I click \"load new game\", it scans for new games then just goes to \"/storage\" and I can't do anything else.

It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.&quot; -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com<br><br>NOTE: Game entirely in English.<br><br>#MadeWithFusion","summary":"Keep an eye on the animatronics and you&#39;ll make it thru the night... probably.","installs":"1,000,000+","minInstalls":1000000,"maxInstalls":1820243,"score":4.700918,"scoreText":"4.7","ratings":129575,"reviews":58105,"histogram":{"1":4797,"2":1269,"3":3088,"4":9575,"5":110842},"price":2.99,"free":false,"currency":"USD","priceText":"$2.99","offersIAP":true,"IAPRange":"$0.99 - $4.99 per item","size":"107M","androidVersion":"5.0","androidVersionText":"5.0 and up","developer":"Clickteam USA LLC","developerId":"8278886069431493261","developerEmail":"ctusallc@gmail.com","developerWebsite":"http://www.clickteam.com","developerAddress":"10010 NE 188TH ST\nBattle Ground WA 98604\nUSA","privacyPolicy":"https://www.clickteam.com/privacy-policy","developerInternalID":"8278886069431493261","genre":"Action","genreId":"GAME_ACTION","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/myJ2kwywsCRglKkZuHBq6Aku9PX7HB75v-8KbnTK9JOPU6z0hpD9xtvjiTGqrn-e4eI","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/jRaERy_DY3j4qSxpszoD3jf6pt-KmiaGRTp3jA7_rM-QUyrl0pV0wqjwU0F2jhHmSYEY","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/GsuEZzJv8D4eMLuWOkh-05iuAXgBT_9479IeYsgqIK1rBKIc84_Bw8Ur65uHlY_wR5I","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1FJU7Vf10ZcPktHxaas7S7_B13NO1GS3evTQDuYORd06fnHJeIdp_r1Z-N7B-JeQi2h6","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/lFIujmFJ2NrAO-7589CMrunUhBpyG70vRKcycJ1dPQVYCBA_BWCi6N5vSu44tDnt5BFo","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Aa1nagrp-j6Yrk1M-s3o_b7wxs00m0MuvILTIBdAUh2cdUSdNZw066TiZw0wxviS57pz","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Ndz00bF8N215nBOOvCyNRGuvoiUyGBiq30qTNvoBLv3kda03bblz7XoaNIjCW7nL8BSH","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xF71XEXeQCjpYPmDl36BwGhmGDt-hAlLjlHa9fcu0rWat8cdtqvoanAc43AGFFM5HAd0","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3wJ_rpRAgx5OigkyIgVfdJ-V8sAAqZNxfLnOcIWYGK2a6AQtvD9dHKJhVhwxNYhoB2Q","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rIbpYvqIgFsgW7jRzlsHqWZOmupsBcTeLRc-WiMrDUVCvLNMmrK_yavchrxL0KOhQ-E","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IHiQYHOTzvY5nNY8Hs7tJBB7Xh8q7ScUXomqbutnFzBZaImJ8ziwVhJ5hIT0VX9diQE","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/hejEJA1ZxSNByDuh1WDglM8GQwSHqx-uAkQAOZJTutGZobM3tNbmzEXloE4ciHjb6VQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/PCOoLE6k452wpWg5w3fInyUGvnuOj01q3xvVAgF-ADMemQH1JpPH_yxSg3Vo_uhE32Px","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/wf43nP-qsOg_OTNl6HJlX_gz9Zr2WfBk2Ihr27uJEtTapA5iG-uHa_AGPiwgDJCtie4","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/oLl7qt7l4pjjmupojqDwy_Tt-bOlfb4uFJa-HL1VJkPUallw4BLCRQcekqhz9Qz3b_8","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-OFqeGG96ssFmArk_Kg0zHn5FQQm2uE1QltJMvsmTpVTKqA51rEfULztOuntpbCZ993z","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/HIP21t5iru0eSyAgFkG07nmKn2PoNAdOtQgIJo5S4e8BnkjCUBMM383ahB_xcN3vxLc","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/qFf1iUriRM_eyU5UgOohTKRfAPtZe6mxnFI4r0k1Lq16LJR07TkoxkOxj4ElBP7_pwlQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/cjF7Amqomp2kz1oUbCdUiVmnRrz1BmBFeXwz2UGkRUC1ACwftTrOhI1b7BAz7HN1wCZA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/dnItqtkgJTDqDGaWcXNdMlWS74AAi5HT4crT0vH90Kthw9M6uZRiKxHxIfKt1P2ZUg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/7qJVk5Smp7I-SiQmzD5FtImRQ9iqRBaftLDVZ4ZNrzBi3hEkUQbZVt_gt69Pj7Bu1F8","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/4J3MnjNXUU0oQkRvPj4eSEpGSNryH-wSQobui4YvmZAa5L-HocRMbXe3g-399LhVhIT1","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/003-K9Qwo80w2DF45qvYaf681lT0pxKUpEu7QHJvwJiCIHvUZm7xk46HSYdfD3DZyg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-1KlkKP4FnnPvU7bvc4RDZyISpD-NJzzZGy3GX30zKD-7nz5wr0nR-kD3DwtneKWTCHQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/t95qn__0iJTHMhrnloqa6nS-F5oJoyHaPfU373kk0PmV7CXxav0frDtHThd2d9hy_Q","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/TQxf6Px6HYhXfAo7NN60xmls0mIfoTdybuI58ZC_Zrl7wLPe2vTNTCEPdhC1hqlP9Q"],"video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/u8H0pazYY5I?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","videoImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/jRaERy_DY3j4qSxpszoD3jf6pt-KmiaGRTp3jA7_rM-QUyrl0pV0wqjwU0F2jhHmSYEY","contentRating":"Teen","contentRatingDescription":"Fantasy Violence","adSupported":false,"released":"Aug 24, 2014","updated":1596265837000,"version":"2.0.2","recentChanges":"- Options screen<br>- Improved audio support<br>- Various fixes and improvements","comments":["The game is scary, but also a heap of fun! If you get it right It's easy to get through the first few nights, but then it becomes hard. I just completed the 6th night and now I'm trying to complete the 20/20/20/20 mode. This game is 100% worth it even on tablet and Ipad. Playing on a phone isn't very easy so I recommend playing on pc or tablet. Definitely worth the money!","No problems yet with the game... As i didn't have any problems with prior games before affording this one i believe i am not going to have any. And the update this game has got made out of this game a 100% full FNAF experience in hands. This game really needed to get that update. Great work for the developers of this game and hope we can expect more from this team coming our way!","This game has all the details, all the jumpscares, all the sounds, the only problem is that on night 4, my power keeps running out ridiculously fast. Like one round, my power jumped from 22% to 11% in 1 second. Then, on another round, my power jumped from 11% to 0% instantly, THEN on 15% with only 1 door closed, my power went out. Please fix that.","Uh hello, hello, I would rate FNaF a perfect five stars. It is a great horror survival game to play and very challenging to beat. I have beaten all 6 nights plus custom night (night 7) within a month and two weeks. I have no problems with the game and recommend to anyone who wants a good scare. (Warning you will die a lot in this game)","So much fun, the adrenaline rush and paranoia you get makes the game soooo much fun. The scares aren't even that scary, just the fact that you don't expect them, and the setting is already scary enough! Though, when Freddy starts coming out, a lot of the time you can't even catch him. You need to pay attention to Freddy and Foxy, which is super hard, I'm on night 4 and having problems with it.

It has great mechanics and fun gameplay,but I can't justify actually buying it. The base game is very small with just 1 Park and 1 board. The rest locked away by microtransactions; if this was a free game, I would totally understand. But for a game that cost actual money and still has this and ADS???? Absolutely not. The prices of just a single park is also garbage, with the average costing more than the original games price. It's a slap in the face","Its a good game, the graphics are good but its just not at all worth buying. This game costs money and all you get is a small map with a skateboard, to unlock other stuff you have to pay MORE money. C'mon guys, how much money do you need! Make maps cheap and make them cost coins and not real money. If you do so then I'll update this review to a 5 star review but for now please don't buy this pay to play game, its just a horrible waste of money","This is the best skating game available on the mobile market. Sure you have to pay for it, but it supports the devs, and gives you a better experience gameplay wise. The skill curve is high, but the enjoyment from mastering it is undeniably satisfying. Highly recommended.","i paid for the game and a few extra skate parks. it is good, but parts of it are glitylchy sometimes, eg, recently i opened the app and the custom camera FOV is stuck at 108367 and still is, there are other minor problems but it is still a very good game! >also i think it would be really cool if they made a night mode :D >i use it often because i want to feel like im getting my money's worth but fr ut didnt really cost much u guys are being kinda stingy :/ lol >you have to get good at the game","For a paid game it's pretty bad. You get very few things that are accesed with ingame currency and it's very hard to obtain said currency without buying it with real money and the game's mechanics isn't consistent. The missions are incredibly hard because the sensitivity setting doesn't transfer over. On the bright side the community is amazing and what they do with the weekly challenges and engaging with their audience is awesome. But what you get without paying for ingame items it's terrible."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.trueaxis.trueskate","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.trueaxis.trueskate&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Mini Metro","description":"Mini Metro, the sublime subway simulator, now on Android.

Initially opening the game I thought it would take up just a bit of time. It has kept me coming back! I had to remove it from my home screen so I'd stop \"one more minute\" playing.

Enhanced visuals and everything runs smooth. No load screens or major glitches for me. Touch controls are as you would expect, difficult. Definitely recommend a gamepad like the Razor Kinshi or just pair a PS4 or Xbox One controller. You aren't playing on console, you're having all this in your pocket. Keep that in mind and you'll love it.","It's a good game but I'm giving it 2 stars for the reason that I can't even download it on the Google Play Store so I have to download a apk of the app which is annoying. Also when I get into cars they always swerve to the right without my input so I either have to walk or get a bike. Which is sad because this is one of my favorite gta besides 4.","This game is getting 4 stars and not 5 for one ridiculous reason. Whoever programmed this game decided to make the run button and the jump button THE SAME GODDAMN BUTTON 🤯🤬😵🤯🤬 WHY??? I PLAY GTA3 ON THE PHONE AND I PLAY VICE CITY ON THE PS4. IF THEY DECIDE TO REPROGRAM THE CONTROLS FOR THIS GAME, THEN THEY WILL GET 5 STARS BUT UNTIL THEN... THEY DONT CARE THEY ALREADY GOT THE MONEY.","This game is amazing, the graphics may not be up to scratch but the resolution and fps are top notch along with the story where you have to redeem yourself to a drug lord in vice city. This is one of the greatest games i have bought and hope that they make a remastered version. The bugs in the game are minor, like crashes here and there (normal). I also had to experience a problem with the driving, everytime I got into a car it would drift left regardless of which buttons I pressed Overall 100%","Amazing! Loved being able to play this on my Samsung Galaxy. The controls take some getting used to and it can be hard to maneuver the camera to the correct angle compared to playing on a console but once you get the hang of them it's great. Loved the 'Retry' options for missions, keeping all your previous weapons etc. meaning you didn't need to reload your save each time. Total nostalgia and was able to complete all the missions - 5 stars!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.rockstargames.gtavc","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rockstargames.gtavc&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"THE GAME OF LIFE 2 - More choices, more freedom!","description":"For 60 years THE GAME OF LIFE board game has shown us how to win at growing up.

Totally worth it to buy the season pass. I do agree that it feels odd to charge for the base game and then make people pay for the different unlocks, but it keeps me entertained as well as something to do to pass the time with the kids while we're waiting in line or on long car rides.","Game is great and so fun. However, lately, my single games keep freezing and I don't get anything from them. Even if I \"Save and Leave\" when I get back it opens a new game and all the progress is gone. I hope this issue can be solved so I can play.","Extremely limited content for a paid game. Very little variation. And extra boards cost more then the game itself.

Pokemon games really benefit because you can trade and battle just like the original hardware. It's a bit of a trial to get it all set up, but when you do you get the best GBA experience in my opinion.","My phone keeps getting silent permission requests for my gmail accounts from this app. There is nothing within the app itself indicating why it's doing this, no reason it should need that; I haven't enabled or allowed Google drive sync or anything else. Really sketchy and makes me upset that I paid money for it, on top of the constant notifications being annoying. On a side note, I really wish there were turbo options for the d-pad buttons. But given the privacy violation I just want a refund","Fantastic emulator, but it definitely needs some updating as it's not the best it could be for a premium item. I personally haven't had the issues some others have, but that doesn't invalidate their troubles. Also, guys, there is indeed a reason why it runs in the background and has email activity -- It's literally for the save backups and sync options. Just turn that feature off if it troubles you.","Used to love this app. But will be uninstalling now. Recently it started asking for email permissions which seem unnecessary and the app is now turning itself on and running in the background multiple times a day. I'm very attentive to apps running in the background and have a habit of making sure everything is off when I set down the phone. Everytime I pick up my phone now My Boy! Is running in the background and asking for permissions that I'm not comfortable giving. 5 stars to 1 star.","Great Emulator. The email request is so it can save your games which is oretty cool but I just turned it off. You can place the buttons anywhere on screen with the pro version and add custom buttons like turbo.

I was pleasantly surprised when people were accurate about this game's similarly to city skylines. I think the only things I'd like to see added are a city park builder (like you get the pieces and build your own of any size) and a region customizer for new regions instead of generating a new one each time you don't like what you get. As a math nerd, finding a game that allows me to enjoy optimizing my strategy is a huge win. You don't have to do that tho..","I agree with the comments, it is a great game and the best game I played in type of building city games. I really like that the time to build structures are only seconds or just short since I'm not a fan of waiting too long for it to be build. I like that the people living in your city talks too and shows talk bubbles. They're pretty interesting and funny to read. Overall, I'm enjoying this game! Good thing I discovered it! ^_^","Love the game! Really is good, been playing it now for probably 4 days straight, any free time I get. I have one suggestion, maybe make an option to spin the buildings? Its not a game breaker but it would help in city design. Such as the aquarium, ferris wheel, and even stuff like the town hall, in case I just wanted it facing a different way lol","An excellent substitute for the greedy gotcha Sim City games out there. No microtransactions. One time fee, and it's next to nothing. The game has a limited number of events, upgrades etc. But it is a well paced game with a great interface. If nothing else, try the free version and see it for yourself. This even eliminates some of the tedium of the Sim City series.","Best game I've played in ages. No pay to win rubbish. Progress seems matched with your play time, so no matter how long you play for, your money and xp keep up with you so you never have to wait for anything to happen. I've played this so much recently, it's a great way to kill time! Love that there's no ads, no in app purchases which seemingly every game in the world has to have these days.

The game is very immersive, the puzzles aren't too hard but not too easy, the hints are reasonable and don't give away too much information. Overally, it was a very pleasant experience for me. One thing thought that I would love to have my game data synced across device since I had to play from the beginning when I changed my device.","Fun, original & just enough of a challenge to make you actually think a little without getting stuck at any point for so long you eventually give and open up YT. I feel like that last aspect alone is phenomenal because when it's all done you get a sense of accomplishment having done it without any help whatsoever. I'm sorry, but anyone who claims this game isn't any good (insert lame excuse here) needs to either get their head examined or just be real and say you didn't care for it in general.","The game I have been looking for. A fantastic puzzle game, much like Riven or Myst from my throwback days of gaming in the 90s. Great graphics and gameplay is fast, and thoughtfully dynamic at parts (you'll see what I mean, no spoilers). And for only a buck! Wow. I have purchased all the rest of the series, keep up the great work!","Three chapters in and already loving it. The controls are practical and easy to get used to. The game itself is very mysterious and it has an interesting story line to follow by finding letters in between puzzles. The puzzles are challenging enough to not be boring but not to the point to be frustrating and not fun. Even if you get stuck, there is a button in the corner that gives you clues. 100% recommend.","500 words is not enough for what I have to say about this game. So I'll make it short and sweet. This game is utterly phenomenal! It is and outstanding work of art! If you like puzzle games with mystery and an intriguing story, then this game is for you! Well worth the small amount of money you pay! I love the idea of each box containing lots of small puzzles within it. The notes left by the mystery A.S make a great story! It's interactive, gripping, and makes you think outside the box!

Anytime I save on the World Map in 600 AD, the game will not load my save. I was able to get around it with the bookmark feature and the apparent autosave when you enter and exit a room, but if the autosave is on the WM in 600AD, it locks out again. What can be done about this?","This is a near perfect port of one of my favorite RPGs of all time. I love the inclusion of the anime cutscenes, updated script, bonus dungeons, and controller support. However, I do kind of wish it included the option of choosing between the hi-def sprites or the classic SNES sprites. It would also be neat if the font was on par with the one seen in the NDS and Steam versions. Still, these are minor nitpicks. Overall, I'm very impressed!","Not bad but awful controls, battles are fine but walking around and interacting are terrible, sometimes you have to be pixel perfect just to talk to someone and if not you have to walk away and hope you've gone back to the right spot. Not worth the frustration for the price.","It's great to play this again chrono trigger is still one of my all time favorites as it is for many who play this.

The fair games tent of horrors will give you a good idea of what you'll be in for.

An absolutely heartwrenching story that has you wishing you could reach through the screen and hug your child and tell them that everything's okay. It brought awareness to an issue that I had never even heard of before playing this game, and the lasting damage the Nazis brought to Norway long after they left. WELL worth the money, especially given that it goes to supporting real children born of war. Also just a great game.","This game is one of the best games I've ever played story wised, the feelings and emotions that you feel durring the game makes you feel connected to kluas/karin but the worst part is that this stuff does happen in the real world! This app does a wonderful job in spreading a message and connecting to many people who might have went through something similar, i would highly recommend this game to everyone in the world who has a heart so 5/5 stars for me!","Fun in a way! Sweet. Historical. But most of all, Very, Very. SAD. Don't underestimate that. This is borderline depressing. None of the reviews reflect/warned that well enough for me lmao. Literally from the start of the game, everything just gets sadder until it gets downright disturbing. Worth the play, just make sure you're in the right headspace.","so i am absolutely in love with this game. i love the premise and i find the child that we're looking after so endearing. but with that said, this game is unplayable for me. it cannot leave the app without being restarted from the beginning of the game. it wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't a long game but the story itself is slow-burn and contrived. like i said, i would LOVE to finish this game and i really hope that somebody could help fix this issue. for now, though, my review stays 2 stars.","This game is a sad but also fun and entertaining game. In total it goes on for about 5 hours, and it has really good graphics. The story and the way you play is well made. Although, I wish that Klaus and Karin had different stories, because I finished playing with Karin and started Klaus, and so far, it is the same. But I recommend this game a lot"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.Sarepta.MyChildLebensborn","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Sarepta.MyChildLebensborn&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Incredibox","description":"Incredibox is a music app that lets you create your own music with the help of a merry crew of beatboxers.

What I did notice is that every other version from alpha to Alive seems to be working fine, with it consuming a considerable amount of memory, depending on what phone I use. V7 and 8 seems to make the app crash even after I pressed play and before the characters loaded in. It is a fun little game but it requires some optimization.","Extremely addicting, and its also really easy to use and does not require any knowledge of music making to use. My favourite version would have to be V4 \"The Love\", I think all of the versions are really well made and are all very unique. Another thing I find good about this game, is that it is actually very difficult to make something that sounds bad, which is great for me because I suck at making music lol. Definitely worth my $7, I cant wait until V9 comes out!","I originally found Incredibox when it was first a website and they only had the 1st version out. I kept playing till the 4th version was out and then I stopped. Today I was looking for a new game to play on my phone and then I found this game in the Top paid games and immediately recognized the icon for the game. Yes! take my money this game is fun. Can't wait for future version to come out. 😁","Definitely fun playing around, but I'm definitely looking forward for the next pack to drop and see what kind of new variety there is. <3 P.S. I suppose an option to flip your phone and have the screen turn with it, but that's just a personal opinion.","I just bought it now, I was quite sad of how the price basically doubled from £2 to £5, also now I've gotten it, I've noticed when I try to download or share it says there was a problem maybe the servers are down or something, but I'll rate it 4/5 because of that, either than that the game is pretty sound and amazing.

The purchase is absolutely worth it! :Ps if you want a fun and perfectly balanced challenge then set bb,jj,Bonnie,Nightmare,Nightmare Fredbear,El chip,all phantoms, Springtrap,Molten Freddy,Afton,Ennard,pig patch happy frog, mr hippo,Golden Freddy,trash&the gang,toy chica,toy Bonnie,withered Bonnie,old man cons and phone guy all to 20 good luck ;)","The game is great! It's easy to control, almost as easy as the PC version, but you do have to look at the doors to close them unless your in the cameras. The game does lag a little, but that's my phone and not the game. I have a pretty weak phone, and it STILL runs great. I don't see why it costs money when the PC version is free though, so not entirely worth the money but still a good purchase.","I think this game is awesome! But some of the characters are missing I'm ucn like funtime freddy which kinda made me sad because he's basically my favorite fnaf character, but overall I do think this game is great and I play really often! If you don't have It I would recommend buying it it's only $2.99 ($3.00) just like the other fnaf games which is a little surprising but awesome at the same time! :)","I love this game, you can make the animatronics go so easy on you, then make every single one of them go Super Saiyan on you!!😂😂 I love this game, and I highly recommended if you like Five Nights at Freddy's!!","I really enjoy this game! However it can be a bit finicky with the touch controls at times.

Only issue I think you could switch it up and throw some new locations levels maps whatever you want to call them. The same old level is a lil boring now and the only reason I give it 4/5. Do that and it would set it off and this would be one dope shooter. And ill give it a quick 5/5. Let's see if you appreciate the fans input.","I love the game. It's a challenge. Money isn't an issue. The missions could be more clearly explained. Wish the levels were different. Smooth graphics. Game play awesome. You will spend time playing this.","Thanks for deleting my previous review. I originally gave this title a one star for the amount of greed that's in and I still am. Gameplay and the map are great! The negatives start with costs. Each rifle costs real world money they can range from $1-$100+, I'm wondering why do you need to pay for assests that you've already paid for.

Once you play enough times, you aren't as scared anymore, but it's still great in many other aspects. The story, the concept, the characters, it's definetly a classic in my book. Though, there's still some issues. On Night 6 Foxy will kill you at random. When he's in the hallway, he kills you. When he's NOT in the hallway, he'll still kill you at random. It's extremely frustrating especially on this night. I'm sick of trying to beat the same night constantly","Uh hello, hello, I would rate FNaF 2 a perfect five stars. FNaF 2 is a great horror survival game to play in your free time. I have completed all nights and bonus nights except 10/20 mode. I do have two problems with the game that sabatoge me from playing or even winning. The camera will lock in place and then I can't toggle out to check the hallway, also the flashlight on night 7 freezes to much and prevents me from checking the hallway. Overall great game to play if your looking for a scare.","This is a fabulous game! It is very fun and appropriate for people who don't mind getting jump scared! It is super affordable too and is worth the money. I would recommend buying this game 100%!

Is it possible to add a speed button, and maybe controller support xD I miss the DS feel.","I love this game but this version is not functional on my pixel 3xl.

While it's impressive they were able to port the entire game over to mobile, they sacrificed a few key ingredients that made the game have its original charm. The dialogue is completely different for one, there was absolutely nothing wrong with the text in the original game, but they decided to make it British-English. Also, the combat is much too fast and not traditional, as well as different bad sounds","Absolutely incredible to have this game back in my life again.

All the sound effects and characters are the same, but the interface is different for mobile use, but it's easy to get used to. The only thing I don't like is that you can't redecorate the lobby, and after you've purchased all the extras, you don't have anything to do with your money. A plus though is that the game doesn't require data/wifi so it's perfect to play while traveling in a plane or car without internet access.","This is a great game! There are no ads at all and if you are bored this is the game that will get you up and running. A great timekiller and doesn't waste battery.

Big fan of TD games and this is a very nice version. Only at early stages and already providing challenges but well balanced research tree is helping get me out of some holes. Well done developers! Edit : Now finished the game but it's provided many tens of hours of enjoyment. If I could award more than 5 stars I would. One of my all-time favourite games.","12+ hours of challenging tactical tower defence. For the price you pay it is a very reasonable experience, would buy a game 2.0 or a DLC for a similar price. Learning curve is reasonable as you develop various strategies for each level. Nuclear mortor torrents are very effective late game. My hot tip is do the normal difficulty on a level then repeat the same level on hard. If you want a good, fun, reasonably challenging tower defence give this a go.","I liked the graphics, took me back to some of the old tiled scifi games from the past. The developer has gone a different direction with some of the economy and mechanics than other TD games and I think overall that makes the game less difficult and includes a lot more waiting and watching than I would prefer. I think it also makes strategy pretty standard, I never changed my strategy and always won. I beat the game through nightmare in a couple days and wish it was more challenging.","Worth every penny, its a fun and challenging game, like a tower defense version of star craft. Devs clearly care and put a lot of effort in this, I also liked the fact that each review have a real reply and not a canned response. Maybe next game we can play as the alliens 😉. Looking foward to see more games from you.","For a game that was just under 3$ it was fun and nice not having to take the wallet out to play more then 5 levels. Just finished the easy mode and it was relaxing. Still had to strategies the turrets but i didn't have to buy a 15$ to beat it. No hassles, just play and enjoy. Very refreshing. Graphics are super simple but they work and for 3$ i aint complaining. Good job.

No one in their right mind playing 2D action RPG with touch input anyway. This is a decent port of the PS1 game. It's decent but not perfect. For the starter, all the assets are ripped straight out from the first game. The BGM and sprites are quite acceptable but sound effects are down right horrible. I understand that the price already justifies the quality but I still hope they at least remaster some assets. Anyway, it's good game.","This is the best version of the game and the touch controls are not bad because of the spell shortcut buttons on screen. However, this game really shines if you have a Bluetooth controller like the 8bitdo. I use the SNES style with phone clip attachment and that experience is wonderfully accurate to the original psx game. The voice acting was updated but they did a good job and stayed true to the original script. Plus, they didn't modify the original masterpiece of a soundtrack.","THANK YOU!!! Noticed a few sounds were changed again, which is a nice touch seeing i own the ps1 and psp versions also. The buttons could use a little work as i kept getting killed because i somehow either missed the buttons or the sensitivity is off...Either way, im SOOO glad to see it here. Hopefully since the sega saturn version character (marie) was added, they added the missing levels and items that we never got here also. By far one of the greatest games of all time.","Don't do it. There is a bug with the mist ability that won't allow you to finish the game. Even if you connect a Bluetooth controller the result is the same. It sucks because it was looking to be a decent way to play this gem. Save yourself a stage 5 meltdown and play it somewhere else. Thanks for wasting my time Konami.","It does what its supposed to do. Its a solid port of a great classic game. The only negative thing I have to say is that its incredibly difficult to play without a controller (maybe Im just bad). Its not a great \"on the go\" game, because some of the boss fights were unplayable without my PS4 controller."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"jp.konami.epjCastlevania2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.konami.epjCastlevania2&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Dungeon Village 2","description":"A new legend begins here!\r\n\r\nBuild and manage a town in grasslands, snow fields, even in the underworld!

This game brings a lot to the table and I have only just begun! Love the way each character can do multiple jobs and become stronger and stronger! I am still trying to figure out how to make my income positive instead of being in deficit most of the times, but I guess that's one of the beauty of the game: You are free to do as you wish! Build, destroy, rearrange and go out there and kill some monsters and raid some dungeons!","Really fun game, with surprising depth. As other reviewers have mentioned, the pop ups (not ad related, but part of the gameplay), are extremely annoying after you start rolling through the game. I think the developers need a better way to manage them, perhaps putting all the info into one pop up or something. Otherwise, the idea of building up your little town, bringing in adventurers and leveling them up, is really fun. Easy to get attached to your town and people.","Totally worth the money. They add so many small details, if you've played their earlier games, you'll see the improvements on this one. I've always been a Kairosoft fan so definitely gonna be waiting on the next game with just as much, if not more, details on customization with the houses, characters, monsters and placement of things.","Well worth the few bucks to buy. Got five star village by the end of my second day playing, and think it would be fun to play it again. I see the validity of the complaints about pop-ups. One thing I would suggest is on the pop-up, add a small button to take you to the settings where you can choose to speed up the pop-ups and mute the sound on it.","Alot of improvements over the first game. My only complaint is that the more efficient you are the more information pop-ups occur which you have to tap through.

The moment I click \"pay,\" my phone suddenly restart without downloading the app. I contacted the developer through their email to have it refunded or provide me access to it. Then I searched, you will have to contact Google, instead, for a refund. I'm glad I was refunded so I repurchased the item. Overall, I am satisfied with the emulator. It did not give me much headache on how to set it up.","Took over a year to fix, but Bluetooth controllers connecting or disconnecting while the emulator is open no longer causes it to crash for me. I'm very grateful for this. Finally allowed the option to pause the emulation when unfocused as well. It's a solid PSX emulator, probably still one of the best on Android, with easy to understand options. It still has a few issues however, and I've noticed since the last update, it seems to be stuck in portrait mode until you start a game.","This is nostalgic. I used to play using this emu on pc back in the day, it work great and free too. When I saw this on Google playstore, I went and bought it, even if I don't really play ps1 games nowadays. I wanted to support Devs for giving us an option for our entertainment for so many years.","Best PSX emulator out there. Plenty of options, flawless save state system, huge amount of customization to adjust to what works best for you and your device. I can replay games from my childhood on the go and relive those memories anywhere. Thank you for creating this!","If you want to relive some of those ps1 games on Android you need this app. Once you're app is set up and downloaded the relevant roms(games) just click and you're games are loaded. Invest in a mobile game pad to make proper use of the app as the virtual buttons on the screen take up a lot of room and can be really fiddley. The app is really stable on my phone with no issues, highly recommend."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.epsxe.ePSXe","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epsxe.ePSXe&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Five Nights at Freddy's 4","description":"NOTE: A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\r\n\r\nIn this last chapter of the Five Nights at Freddy's original story, you must once again defend yourself against Freddy Fazbear, Chica, Bonnie, Foxy, and even worse things that lurk in the shadows.

I feel like the way straw works needs a little work though. When you drive over the icon to set it down next to your barn, unless the machine drops it directly over the icon it doesn't work right and straw flies all over the place. Either that needs to be fixed or maybe you could set it up so that way your character could pick up one at the time, seeing as there doesn't seem to be a point to getting out of your vehicle otherwise. Again, great game, needs a few kinks worked","Terrible game play... there are a few good additions but there are very few options and on some aspect it is very clunky compared to FS 16. I addion when you have to pay to buy the game and then if you want to get set up there are not many options and they want you to buy more coins after you just purchased the game... oh and I can't get a refund either.","I would love to play but I cant because its so laggy. I can even drive a tractor. But I will give it two stars for one thing I always wanted in the game and that is walking. So can you fix the lagging. It would help alot. (Also my graphics are on low) I enjoy playing farming simulator 15 more than this. My device in LG Style 6.","The only thing I would say to the creator of this game is that when such a good game was made, it would have made some other things good, only a small size would increase the size of the game. 1.There is no camera feature 2. No facility to keep hay and straw 3. Animals don't actually eat food and don't even drink water. 4. There is no steering option for the vehicles I request the creator of this game that we have spent a lot of money, please give us all these features too. Thank you","(1) I just began to feel the game. So far it is okay only one thing I can say the wheat, canola,corn do not look so good that do not look real. Farming simulator sf16 looks must better. I will give more comments us I go.👍😴 (2) The steering on the vehicle is to sensitive I adjust it more and less bad there is a little difference, I play on x10 speed. It is a fantastic game to play.👍🏅🏅."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.giantssoftware.fs20.google","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.giantssoftware.fs20.google&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Bad North: Jotunn Edition","description":"Your home is under attack.

I've played about 8 hours so far, but suddenly my data has gone, which is frustrating as you do unlock stuff. I've contacted the developer so we'll see how they respond. If this saving issue is resolved then the game is well worth the money! Edit: lost another star because it wiped my data again...","Good game, bad optimizing. Overall this game is quite pleasant, it has a unique and cool artstyle, and decent gameplay, it is a wonderful strategy game and i have no complaints on the game itself (yet.) However, the optimization for mobile seems to be lacking, as the rampent game crashes made it nearly unplayable in a campaign, now this wouldnt have been that bad, but the fact that each time it crashed it would reset a portion of my campaign progress, made this a bad experience for myself.","Great game, good controls, awesome graphics. I do think there should be more content, like an event or a bigger skill tree. But overall, I loved this game, very enjoyable. There is one thing though, there's a bug where pressing start doesn't work, nothing happens. It doss this from time to time, don't know if it's just my device... Anyway, I'll edit this review when those things happen. Worth the price.","Awesome game nice graphics I love the islands shapes and sizes. but they need to add more variety of units for the good guys.I have three suggestions. Like mace men they're skill would be spinning attack which they spin in a circle across a straight line. Then spearman they're skill would be destruction which they throw they're spears and last but not least javalin men they have shields they're skill would be barrage when they throw their spears each kills three men in the boat . That is all !!","This is an exceptional defense game with sweet graphics and cool sound effects. I she enjoyed playing the game. Pros, graphics, sound effects, scrolling in and out, challenging, easy to play. Cons, it's hard to remember all of the saved attributes that you can gain during the game including the bonuses to your commanders. It takes a while to play and get good at it but it is enjoyable.

But it is fun alot of cool options","This is my favourite game I have and also my favourite part is when you have to do tasks you and check up on animatronics you can either do throw the animatronics back into the alley and other stuff you can even buy things and that's probably my favourite second favourite parts and I love lefty good job got a good job Scott on making lefty he's probably my favourite Freddy ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐","This is one of the best horror games I've every played 1.

Cars are difficult to steer and seem more slippery on the road than they are in the console version. If you happen to get into a fist fight, fists don't always connect or if pedestrians get into a fight with each other, they sometimes just stand and look at each other until you knock one of them closer to the other, you can't enter cheats like you can on the console.","I think that the game is an awesome blast from the past. I connected the Stadia controller to the Pixek 5 using USB C cable and it worked to play the game, except for moving the camera while driving, but other than that, it works. Now, if only they would update the app to work flawlessly on the Nvidia Shield or Google TV, all would be right in the world.","This game is very fun to play, but there are some issues that stop me from rating it higher. The camera feels a bit too zoomed in, and really limits the field of view. The touch controls are a bit difficult to use and the lack of camera control makes this problem more apparent. The game itself is a great port of the original and the improved visuals are a great plus. The story is alright, a bit crude compared to later installments but still enjoyable.","A great port of the 2001 original with improved visuals and runs incredibly smoothly without issues (Android 11). However, the camera is horrid which doesn't help with the shooting and the analog steering becomes irresponsible which screwed me up a lot of times while driving. This is why I rate it 3 stars.","Boring, hard to control and the story isn't exactly the most engaging, but it WAS made in 2001 so I'll give it a little bit of slack. Plus this game was very influential in gaming with its open world exploration."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.rockstar.gta3","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rockstar.gta3&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"The Game of Life","description":"MAKE CHOICES, GET PAID, OR LOSE IT ALL!\r\n\r\nAttend college, accept a job and play minigames in this interactive app that is fun for the whole family.

Things get easier with practice and building some skill. The progressive upgrade system is neat. My main gripe is that if you get really far and die, starting from the very beginning can be a little disappointing, but that's how the game was intended to work so just be aware of what you're getting into.","Can't even play the game on a controller as the Devs haven't registered ABXY L1/R1 L2/R2. The only buttons that work are the dpad. I've googled it and the problem is wide and known, but nothing has been done about it. Very disappointing as this is a great game, I want to play but I can't because no fix has been implemented.","THIS GAME IS AMAZING AND SO ADDICTING AND AM PROUD TO PAY FOR THIS GAME, IT WAS SO SO WORTH IT. Please, the trial run at the beginning of the game pkease give us an option to set the timer to unlimited, because it would be so much FUN and such an AMAZING and Satisfying option to play through the levels. The idea of starting from the start with just but a sword really gices you a thrill and very hard but very enjoyable and even if you die I can't even get mad because it's so much FUN!!!!!!!!!!!","A great game but unfortunately when they ported it over to the phone they didn't do enough fine-tuning such as /hidden treasures are much harder to find with a much small screen and can be easily hidden by the skill buttons and can be fixed by either brightening the notification or or widening the notification area/ the auto-attack option would have greatly streamlined the gameplay unfortunately it has a glitche and needs to be made so that it will only Auto attack when you press the button."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.playdigious.deadcells.mobile","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playdigious.deadcells.mobile&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"The Room Two","description":"NOTE: If playing on a Tab3, you'll need the Android 4.4 update installed to run the game.\r\n\r\nWelcome to The Room Two, a physical puzzler, wrapped in a mystery game, inside a beautifully tactile 3D world. \r\nThe much anticipated sequel to ‘The Room’, recipient of a BAFTA award, is here at last. \r\n\r\nFollow a trail of cryptic letters from an enigmatic scientist known only as \"AS\" into a compelling world of mystery and exploration. \r\n\r\n*******************************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\n“An incredibly compelling experience with clever puzzles, gorgeous visuals, and a spooky atmosphere; absolutely brimming with new ideas.” – The Verge \r\n\r\n“An intricately woven work of fiction perfectly suited to its format, this is the sort of game that it's worth sitting in the dark for.” - Pocketgamer \r\n\r\n“A gorgeous-looking game offering larger locations with multiple interactive areas and puzzles.

The game outstoods itself one more time, I really enjoyed it and certainly told all of my friends to give it a try. What so amazing about this one is that the second one definitively connect to the first one, and the room itself has more components and they are all interconnected which made the puzzles so intriguing to solve. Already bought the third one and couldn't wait to try it.","Worth. Every. Penny. And. More. The puzzles are reasonably complex and the hints don't give too much away. This game was not only challenging, it was immersive. The eery music and well designed 3D atmosphere set the chilly vibes I've been looking forward to. Don't keep reading reviews. Just buy the game already.","As a game that tests the mind, the puzzles and challenges are ok but nothing hugely complex. Where this game really excels is as an experience - the graphics, the soundtrack, the gameplay.....it's so immersive, right from the get go with the eerie theme music. Play it with headphones and it will leave you on edge, but in a great way. I've played all of the first 3 Room games 2-3 times over the past few years....mostly because I can't remember the puzzles but mainly because I wanted to relive it!","WOW! Best puzzle game that I've ever played! Every element of this game is absolutely fantastic, but special credit definitely goes out to the team that created the absolutely incredible sound effects! They are eerie, chilling, flawlessly created, and so realistic! They add so much to the atmosphere of the game! Somehow the visuals are stunning from every angle! I am always disappointed once I solve the game, because it means I can't live in this incredible world they created any longer.","This is another puzzle box game just like it first very challenging. The only downside I can see on it and the only reason why I removed one star is because I find often that you have to solve two or more puzzles at the same time. It kind of blurs the line between being mentally challenging and mentally taxing."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.FireproofStudios.TheRoom2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FireproofStudios.TheRoom2&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Five Nights at Freddy's: SL","description":"NOTE: A device with at least 3 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Circus Baby's Pizza World, where family fun and interactivity go beyond anything you've seen at those *other* pizza places!

For example, when you get jumpscared it freezes, and from what I've seen I usually have to restart the app. Another problem I've encountered is when you enter a new location (For example, going into a new room or entering a vent) the game \"stops responding\" and makes me restart the whole game AND the night. I've had to restart on just the second night so many times that I just gave up.","One of the best games on play store... But it can only be played once as the game is entirely scripted... But anyway, it doesn't kill off the fact that this game is really good to be trying and although this is one of the most expensive games (if not the most expensive) of the franchise... It is really well made! The story will get you immersed into the game and probably you are going to get addicted to it soon as you learn on how to play. So i'll give it 5 stars","I have loved FNaF forever and I suggest you get sister location. The only thing I had a problem with is that every time I get jumpscared the game just stops loading and I have to exit the game and then get back in just to restart the night! Please fix this if you can! Besides that I love Sister Location. It might just be my computer though lol.","Night 5 is impossible to bear in handheld device. After you get Babies A.I chip. You have to follow her instructions to go left or right to avoid getting caught on the way to the scooping room. She says go forward stop go left but you can't go left or right. Its impossible. It only let's you go straight and you die everytime. 💯 I thought the spring trap on night 4 was impossible but no. This part is actually physically impossible in cellphone for reasons stated above.","this was so amazing, not what i was expecting at first :D i highly reccomend this to anyone who has the guts. can be scary and all in all really fun to play. but really upset me, i was playing on chrome (dont ask) and whenever i did much past night 1 the game crashed. please fix this scott you legend. 2 things: the game works now :D and also goodbye scott, we are all so proud of your work :)"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.scottgames.sisterlocation","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scottgames.sisterlocation&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"FINAL FANTASY","description":"The original FINAL FANTASY comes to life with completely new graphics and audio as a 2D pixel remaster!\r\n\r\nA remodeled 2D take on the first game in the world-renowned FINAL FANTASY series!

Final Fantasy always was and always will be my favorite franchise, and while I'm not afraid to criticize when need be, it's pretty hard to ruin the classics that Sakaguchi was in charge of. The tap and directional pads are helpful for playing in a hurry or exploring, and the game itself has the same aggravating yet gripping adventure as the NES version. Overall I am happy with the remakes.","Whilst I'm happy with the visuals, the music and the gameplay so far, I am really disappointed to see yet another SE game have a pointless online verification step. This is a single player game and a premium paid app. I should be able to play it wherever and whenever, but unfortunately I am at the mercy of having either a WiFi connection or decent enough mobile data to even start the game. Please consider patching this annoyance out, and I'd easily give it a higher rating.","Love it! My only issue is sometimes if I back out and go to the home screen, I'll come back to the game and the screen will be black with the ui controls on top. I'll have no choice but to close the game out and start back from my last save. With that said I can't wait until FF4 is released. Thanks for finally getting around to giving us these games! PS: please release this on PlayStation as well. You'll get my money twice 😊","Game somehow feels disappointing. I've beaten Final Fantasy 30+ times in my life, played on every platform and every version. This one seems off. Cons: 8-way control is too sensitive, I can't walk through doors or talk to people without going off in the wrong direction. Font is not that great, just hard on the eyes. No controller support. No auto save on close. Seems a little laggy at times for no reason. Colors of villages look horrible. Sprites are eh. Pros: Slightly better music.","Bought FF1-FF3. In my opinion, these are the definitive versions of the games in all their 16-bit glory and beautifully done remixed soundtrack. There's only one issue that I (and many others) have: the lack of controller support. Please add controller support. The touch screen is difficult to use and feels clunky at times when traversing on the world map, towns/castles, in dungeons, and when selecting options. Please update the FF Pixel Remasters by adding controller support ASAP. Thank you."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.square_enix.android_googleplay.FFPR","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.FFPR&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Clue","description":"Clue is the classic mystery game!\r\n\r\nNow you can play the beloved Hasbro family board game on the go. \r\nWHO, with WHAT weapon and WHERE?

The first time we tried this we were able to create a room and play with friends via zoom. But now when any of us try to create a room only one person can enter - no more. We tried a bunch and it seems to be not working properly any more . If this could be fixed, it would be amazing.","Got this to play with my other half (she has an I phone and I have a samsung) for the first few days it worked great and we loved it (spent ALOT of money on different boards etc) but now it won't load a game between the 2 phones so I have to use the I pad (which means I can't use all the things I have brought) would give 5 stars but because of this only 1 as it has cost me lots of money and can't use it for what we brought it for.","I've only played single player so far but the AI on hard is enjoyably challenging. The final score screen is buggy and doesn't display my results but it's a fairly minor gripe. If you love Cluedo you'll love this game, they've done a good job.","August '21 update has programming script with oversized font, code in fields where there should be results after you've won. To me, some players have worked out the game's algorithm in order to have scores in the tens of thousands. Sometimes when I should show a card, my cards don't show, so I cannot pick one, I can only click 'Continue.' Other glitches make playing tedious not fun.","Was good, and really happy with it until recently - can no longer play with members of my family who have iphones, can only play with other android users, which was never an issue before.

This is definitely my favourite of the kingdom rush series, and I do hope they keep making them. Can't recommend this game and the rest of the series enough to anyone who likes Tower defence games. Truly master classes in this field. Fun, challenging and a great sense of pop culture humor this game has it all!","I bought Boneheart and I don't exactly regret it, however he needs to be changed a little with the ai, half the time he doesn't attack a target that's right under him or near him, just sits there. He uses the golems and the lane clear moves just fine but in terms of targeting the enemy, lacking. I know it's an older game but I love it ☺️ just please fix Boneheart is all I ask","This game is seriously perfect. I loved playing through the levels and venturing through the different areas. Kingdom Rush Frontiers stayed true to it's previous game and perfectly added on to the previous game's story. It's good in alot of aspects, although I can say it can be a bit too challenging sometimes, even with easy mode. But not always. Oh and it's not pay to win, I do lose alot, but eventually you will get the right defense and beat the level. Just don't give up. Loving the music!","I like this game but I think kindom rush origins was kinda better. The dessert theme is kinda boring and there isn't much unique enemies. But the game is fantastic I just think it should change a few things and it would be amazing. Buy thins if you love kindom rush games.","If you liked the original, you'll like this one too! Pretty much the same so far, just different maps/looks, but I'm only 4 lvls in. Tower Defense/Strategy game, a few basic heros come with the game, extra heros cost $ each, but by no means is this a pay-to-play game (you won't need to buy them to win, they're just different from the ones that come with the game. They're usually a bit better, but that makes sense to me/is fair, since you pay for them)."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.ironhidegames.android.kingdomrushfrontiers","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ironhidegames.android.kingdomrushfrontiers&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Pizza Boy GBA Pro - GBA Emulator","description":"Full featured version of Pizza Boy GBA!\r\n\r\nWarning!

Try it on VBA on my PC? Works instantly. No problems. Easy import and it's done.","I love this GBA emulator! It has 4 different speeds from normal to super fast and it allows you to save and load games. You can also change the skin, move the buttons around. It's very customizable! I love it! Very well worth every penny!","Is there a way to make the dpad more functional for slanted moving? Or is there a analog ui to help it? Edit: found it. The Boundless on the dpad is important in settings. It makes it so you can slide your finger around like analog without exiting the dpad hit box on your screen.","Easily the best GBA emulator on the Play Store. Also highly recommend the Pizza Boy GBC emulator. They run buttery smooth and the skin customization puts them in a league all their own.","Brilliantly app, I love that it runs games without requiring the Roms to be unzipped. Only thing I will say that is a little irritating is a touchscreen is no replacement for a physical d-pad when playing platformers that require precise movement. Not the apps fault, it runs great and the buttons work as well as any touchscreen buttons can, I would just recommend procuring an external controller before tackling games like Metroid."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"it.dbtecno.pizzaboygbapro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.dbtecno.pizzaboygbapro&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Papa's Mocharia To Go!","description":"Create delicious coffee drinks and cannoli in Papa's Mocharia To Go!\r\n\r\n-- ABOUT THE GAME --\r\n\r\nPapa Louie has opened a brand-new coffee shop in New Pepperton, offering a variety of custom layered coffee drinks called Papaccinos.

I remembered i spent 400 hours on the pc part. Now the game is on mobile, it's like a portable workshop come to my hand. There are some bug here and there, yet i'm happy the interface are clean. The only drawback here are it's unable to load my save game from pc counterpart. I really hope in the future they implement this, just like Stardew valley.","Amazing experience so far. So many things to do/create and the AI that let NPCs not stick in one place makes it more fun to play. They don't have to be at the shop to sell/buy items. I'm not really fan of mobile games because of the controlling on screen but this game worth the shoulder pain 😂","Amazing game so far. I was looking for a farming game that is not the usual plant and log out thing and this seems to be it, with relationships and places to explore. Love the graphics, the calm atmosphere and the multitude of details. The quests/commissions are just complex enough to hold your attention. I am only on day 5, so I can't say too much about how it progresses as a game, but so far everything is going great. Looking forward to exploring this world which promises to be intriguing.","Because I'm a big fan of harvest moon series, so this game is a must!!!! Even i never paid for premium game before, but this game was exception, and it's worth!!, I love this game, so much freedom, no ads, no additional paying, the world and the town design was amazing!!!!! You can explore everywhere, do everything, mining, farming, crafting, fishing, and many more.. I love the vibe of this game, so calm, relaxing.. Keep up the good work dev!!! THANKS FOR MAKING MY DREAM RPG GAME COME TRUE!!!!","UPDATE: The most recent game update caused the game to lag when walking or running around strangely. I reinstalled and discovered I lost everything!! So at first there was an issue that prevented playing due to getting stuck at the Google Play Games Login and devs fixed it straight away without hesitation, kudos and thanks so much! Upon starting a New Game I'm greeted with a beautiful game that has great customization, audio, visuals, and lots of fun things to do!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.pathea.mtap","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pathea.mtap&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Bendy and the Ink Machine","description":"Bendy and the Ink Machine™ is a first person puzzle-action-horror game with a unique cartoon atmosphere and an intense, frightening storyline that keeps you guessing throughout.\r\n\r\nHenry was the lead animator at Joey Drew Studios in its 1930s heyday, a studio that was best known for producing animated cartoons of their most popular and beloved character, Bendy.

And that makes it very diffucult to kill simple enemys like seachers. But on computers, laptops, and xbox it does not have that problem. But still, the games pretty good and has good graphics and is pretty addicting.","I absolutely loved this game until the lag took grasp and kept me hostage in chapter 3. The game ran perfectly smooth all throughout chapter 1 and 2 no problem. It wasn't until chapter 3 where the lag gradually worsened to the point of crashing. I tried reinstalling the game and replaying the unsaved progress of chapters 1 and 2 again but still the same end result. Held hostage by lag at chapter 3, can no longer progress, and the ending remains in secrecy. Sad android user noises.","Great Game! It's a bit laggy when you have an old phone but I just hope this game stays in my acc when I get my new phone! . Overall there is a glitch where at the final boss fight bendy gets stuck in a wall when trying to break the glass but this game is pretty swell!","This game was really fun at first but when I got to just chapter 2, I played the song Sammy wanted me to do. So I could open up the gate, but I did it many times, and it still wouldn't open, I was annoyed over 5 minutes but I still really wanted to play so I kept going, then I went on YouTube to see if anyone would help [like the full gameplay] but it still wouldn't work, so over 15 minutes I gave up, I realized that I was basically wasting time. I really want to meet boris. But I can't.","This is possibly one of, or the best horror game of all time! I've only gotten up until about Chapter 3, and then got stuck, and then deleted the app, but now that I am going to redownload it, I remember how amazingly good and fun this game was! I even have around 4-5 plushies and figures of the characters in the game! Anyways, I'm extremely excited for the sequal coming out, and I can't wait for it! Amazing job!

The game devs took sacred geometry and made it into a beautiful, fun, surprising, and challenging game. The simplicity of the gameplay combined with the complexity of the puzzles is a winning combination. The mystical, fantastical elements made me smile. Can't wait to finish this and play Monument Valley 2!","Where do I begin?! This game is absolutely phenomenal. Each level has its own unique characteristics and charm to it. The idea of manipulating environments built upon impossible architecture is amazing. The entire game has this mysterious and mesmerising, whilst also calming atmosphere. The OST, with its ambiance and mystery really complements everything else. This strange world is my home away from home. On top of all this, there's a captivating and engaging story! A brilliant gem! 100/100!! 🙂","It was brilliant, but it was over too soon. relaxing game, was very well made then it was over!!.i had stupidly assumed that i could play it for a few nights at least. dissapointing. I cant see how one plays it again as there is only one way to solve each puzzle. I prefere a game that i can play for longer than an hour. But its still well made and beautiful and worth buying. Just dont expect to be playing it for long and you wont be dissapointed by it. Its truly beautiful.","Very beautiful game, the puzzles are very creative but not so difficult that you give up. I did give up on one part of a puzzle and when I looked up the answer I felt so dumb because of how easy it was! Lovely story as well as graphics, well worth the purchase.","I just played the most horrible architectural puzzle game called Odie's dimension. Story text was off screen, horrible sensitivity, and in the third chapter there was a walking pattern to go through that was utterly ridiculous. As I'm playing the third chapter all I can think is \"Man I need to re-download Monument Valley.\" I re-download Monument Valley and uninstall Odie's Dimension and I haven't even passed the second chapter and I want to worship the devs. Thanks for making such a great game😁"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.ustwo.monumentvalley","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ustwo.monumentvalley&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition","description":"This game is optimized for tablets and not recommended for phones with screen sizes under 7 inches.

throughout the 2.5 Infinity Engine updates and now this much-anticipated update for Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition is coming to you!","comments":["This port is nearly flawless. I own all of the Baldur's Gate (I & II), IWD, Planescape: Torment and Neverwinter Night on both PC & now Android. I finished each & everyone of the ports on my tablet. IMO, IWD & Planescape: Torment are the best of the ports, NWN is the least of them (due to the outdated 3D engine & controls) but still a good game with a well-written story. These games were the best of the RPG genre in their time. These ports offer a ton of play and replay value, the plot twists & character paths are great to experience and revisit every few years, just like the originals. Anyone who loves classic 2D RPGs shouldn't miss these! Oh how I wish I can experience IWD II again.","I really tried to play this game developed a whole group of characters to play started out with stats in the 90s with each character then started the game. I really could not get past the bar the game started in. If the controls weren't so clunky and the text so small this could probably turn out to be an okay game. If they could make the gameplay more like vampire fall it would be a perfect game. As is this game needs to stay a computer game because it just does not work on a mobile.","Really great game and adaptation. As I've gotten older and started replaying the old RPGs I played as a kid in the 90s, this one has come out as my favorite, and I played them all. The key factor in this is being able to full customize your entire party from the very beginning. That factor alone gives me endless replayability not just through the sheer mechanics of designing different combinations of cohesive and supporting skills and classes, but also in terms of theme and RP.","This is an amazing game! So worth the asking price. Beamdog, you have really created the most authentic version of the original classic that I knew and loved as a young gamer. If you have $12.99ish and are looking for an exceptional mobile gaming experience, please look no further than Icewind Dale Enhanced Edition. The game is brilliant. The attention to detail is flawless and the story so compelling I can't put my tablet down. In terms of functionality, the game has worked absolutely perfect for me. I have experienced zero issues with the software. This is a wonderful game, a great story and a true masterpiece of software development. Beamdog unreal work, please keep the classics alive.","Well worth the investment. I bought this game years ago and am now replayin it.

There are no saves between levels, no restarts, and you only have 3 power slots. Can you survive Alien: Blackout?","comments":["Pretty fun game, would definitely pick up for the low price if you're a fan of horror games. It is interesting to control crew members and tell them where to go instead of being up in the action yourself but it also had some suspense when the alien catches up to you in your air vent. The only gripe I have with this game is that outside of the levels there's pretty much nothing to do.","Tbh, I always have the lowest expectation when it comes to mobile games. But this, this just changed my mind. The graphics is amazing, the dialogs and the AI is just as good as the movie. You really need to figure out some strategy for each level and at the same time making sure the alien don't reach into your vent. Maybe some new levels and new storylines would be great. Hope to see some updates","An exceptional reimagining of sorts of the game Alien: Isolation, optimized for mobile devices. It is a good horror-strategy game. All the themes, effects, sound & Xeno creature design & AI are back from the 2013 game & the first movie. Gameplay is tense but fun where you as Amanda Ripley lead your survivors to escape a doomed space station while keeping a close eye on the Xeno using motion trackers and security cameras on a security terminal. Better than 5 Nights at Freddy's gameplay.","Epic overall. Scary experience and fun to finish. Sad that it finished so early. Wishing for a part 2. In the last but 2nd map. The alien seems to be roaming at the same place and not at all exploring the ship. That took me a lot of time to work on. Loved it. Would play more","Yes, This game is like FNAF BUT!!!! It is way better. The graphics are fantastic and they mimic the movies technology very well. It is VERY much a sequel to alien:Isolation. I have recommended this game to every one of my friends and I would do it over agian. This game have different levels of difficulty that give the game a very different feel each time you play a round even though it is the same level just harder. For 0.99¢ this game is well worth it.

Why are family members not at all interested in getting in the bunker???","Pretty cool game. A lot of endings. Although, it takes brain. You really must think through your choices, it's not just random. The game is unpredictable most of the time but that's what makes it fun, wondering would could happen next! You really gotta think about who you're gonna send out and think about endings! Honestly, it is not an easy game. It's actually quite hard. I think my only complaint really is the entertainment I get out of it. It does get boring , sometimes I fail after I get really far and then try again and again. After so many tries, the game can get *so* boring, a lot of reading has to be done too. I'm fully aware that this game Is *not* new, yet , I don't think it's changed much.","The game has really good potential...but the controls in the beginning when you have to run and collect food are so hard to use...many times I'm not able to move my character around...or they move too much.

Cons: Sometimes movement in the house can be glitchy makeing it slightly hard to get stuff, Costs money (but I personally think its worth it) I could go on about this game but ill leave you with this,","I really love this game.

Not a rip off of anything. Original. Hard. I'm majorly stuck on the visualize the cubes puzzle. For the life of me I can't see them as one. I wish the words were bigger and the story line goes too fast and doesn't repeat. Similar to old sins but a different game so naturally things will work differently. For sure worth the money. I give you 8 stars. Only...can anyone help with this puzzle please?","A fun game, very good to pass the time with. A big technical improvement over the previous game. I will say however, that it feels at times that some puzzles wouldn't progress until I used a hint. Several times I found the solution to a puzzle only for nothing to happen, until I activated a hint. Alternatively, some parts of a puzzle/room couldn't be selected/viewed until a hint had been used. This slows the game down, and made me second guess myself when stuck.","Amazing. Controls were much more cohesive this time round. Story was very good. Puzzles were fair, some required a walkthrough as well as the hints as it wasn't super clear what was needed. The numbers on the columns was a bit odd, the ratio was too precise and being off by 0.001 gave the wrong answer.. ended up with 4064 instead of 4063 (or something). The mirror puzzle whilst good, the motion was mildly nauseating and required memory beyond my scope. Just minor things.great game overall!! 5*","One of the best there is! I love the real 3d touch control vs the point and click. Great imagination. Some things require just looking and looking instead of having a good stream of intuitive makes sense play - but I guess you can always have it all. Def reccomend! Right up there with the room series. Too bad they haven't produced anything new in all these years though!","Great puzzles, great story. The style and look of the game is amazing. Just like the first one. Well worth the price to me. I dont know if its just me, i feel like this one was longer than the first.

I don't know rogue like games, but that seems excessive. HOWEVER again, I stuck with the game because it's fun and kept me engaged for a fair bit of time and that speaks to it's quality.","Very fun game, but you practically have to pay an extra 9$-60$ if you want to play more then one level or different characters. After about 40hrs of play time i've unlocked around 4 upgrade, 1 character, and 1 additional level. Despite that, I give this game a 4 star because the game that I did play it is very very fun. TLDR: The progress is so slow in this game that unless you plan on playing this game a lot, you will have to spend a lot of money to play the whole game, but it's still very fun.","3rd time I edit this review. This game could be one of the best I ever had. Replayability is infinite, because mechanics and because the variety of heroes. With that being said, take care with addictive sessions of more than one hour. Remember It gets saved automatically, so you can stop whenever you may need. About money, it will be nice to spend $3 extra, not neccesary but nice boost. Beyond that, there's no need to pay for any other things, furthermore there's plenty of skins and stuff.","I downloaded this game while I was in the emergency room. It surprised me with its quality, and I played it between waiting on staff and sleeping. I've been trying to 100% it since. It's a great deckbuilder, would definitely recommend. My only real gripe is that I feel there should maybe be a way to get the admiral for free. I know it's just like a support the devs type of thing, but it irks the completionist in me.","Biggest gripe: progression is VERY slow without paying for it. I already paid for the game, I didn't really expect to spend more money just to get basic stuff in a reasonable time frame. As a game, it's fine, but mostly luck-based; if you get good cards on a play through you will do well, if not, you won't. I enjoy playing it, but the pay-to-win stuff leaves a bad taste."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.piratesoutlaws.fabledgame","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.piratesoutlaws.fabledgame&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"NBA 2K20","description":"Take classic 2K action on the go with NBA 2K20 for mobile, featuring 5 new NBA Stories, a new MyCAREER storyline, and an all-new Run The Streets mode!

I have severe ADHD and it really gets the dopamine pumpin. And I say that because you are rewarded for just hitting stuff. Enemies aren't too bad in the early game because there's so few of them but as you progress, everything just deepens into this massive game that was so deceptively simple to start. And it is quirky. In some ways that might be just down to the lack 0f a point and click option for placing land blocks, flooring tiles, gates, fences, such.","The game itself is amazing, preaty entretaining and overwealming but there are many problems with it, especialy with the controls, whenever you conect a keyboard or any otrer controler the game crashes and you need to restart it, you cant place your bed, fences, walls, gates, and many other structures without them placing themselves in the incorrect spot, and its preaty dificult to aim at a certain block to build or break anything, and you should be able to configurate your controls in keyboard","It's a lovely game and I really like it! The one thing I've found so far though is that the controls are a little wonky, especially for stuff like placing landfills (which is practically impossible in many places because of this), and that it's not clear that the Feat rewards are not supposed to be immediately rewarded, but that you (I think) have to find an in-game place to claim them.","This is a great game, put 12h into it and loved every minute of it. I am giving 2 stars because while this game is really good,there is a nasty bug where your upgraded tools disappear making it so you can't progress in the game. After putting 12 hours into this game and experiencing this bug I am not longer playing this game and we'll not start a new game in the event I lose another 12 hours to this bug. If not for this bug I'd give it a 4-5 stars.","Forager is such a good game, it is alot of fun i had playing it, and there is alot of stuff to do so you will be playing it for a while, overall, amazing experience and its completely worth the money.

This is the fourth one I've played and, even though there are some elements in common between all of them, this one still surprised me and occasionally stumped me. Fantastic! I also appreciate how they toned down the occultic bits as well. Spooky but still safe for kids. I hope they make another one!","Loved this game. Took about 9hours to complete, but I took my time. Not a bad amount of game time for only 5 bucks. I enjoyed the graphics and puzzles. Sometimes I could't move on because I wasn't sure what it wanted me to do next. The hints helped out a lot for step by step directions. Usually it was just some mechanic that I didn't know was on the screen, to turn something or open something. I would highly recommend this game.","This is the fourth game in the series and you see the progression in the settings, length of game play, as well as the jump in the cost. The developers have really done themselves proud even if at first I never liked the idea of where it was set but soon warmed to the absolutely stunning graphics, sounds and puzzles. There was one annoyance for me and that was looking into the water, trying to move something a mm and it would move a lot further. Took me 2 hours to do this puzzle.","This was the best room escape game I've ever played and as someone with ADHD it was nice that it didn't involve a ton of short term memory parts, at least easy enough that I didn't feel overwhelmed with having to remember 8 digit codes or letters. It had a great plot, mystery, intrigue, and I love how they interweaved all of the puzzles. I also very much appreciate 0 ads and a flat price. It's so rare to find games like this so thank you guys for creating this game! It was worth the price+!","I think that The Room Three may be my favorite game in the series, but the concept of this game makes it a very close 2nd. I absolutely love the intricacy of the dollhouse and I only wish there had been more rooms to explore. Just like it's previous counterparts, this game provides a beautifully crafted journey that will leave you wanting more. Two thumbs way up devs!!

However, it's missing quite a bit of stuff. Not seeing some rides or scenery I'm used to, less paths and queues to pick from, and the scenario editor is gone. Still, lots of fun for $6. Update: Tried to buy a DLC pack but when it went through it said purchase failed, yet my card was charged. Not liking that.","This game is a lot of fun probably my favorite out of all the roller coaster tycoon games. It is like an upgraded and cheaper version of roller coaster tycoon 2. The only problem I have with this game is that its saving system is not that good and i have lost stuff overwriting files because it is very easy to accidentily do that.","I like the PC version but got the app a few months ago and LOVED it. great game, no issues. This past week or so, with a new phone, I haven't been able to play more then five minutes before it'll crash on me. It seems to me that the edit mode is setting it off, which is fine normally because I don't build my own rides. However just accidently clicking on the name of a ride and trying to click out of it is crashing my game and losing whatever progress I've made. It is beyond frustrating.","Great for nostalgia, plays pretty much exactly the same as rollercoaster Tycoon 2 on PC. You can play offline,and there is no pay to play/pay to win rubbish. You buy the game and get the full game. You can also purchase expansion packs. I would like to see an easier way of backing up saved games, the only way is to export them individually.","Real blast from the past!

Note for the devs: I would really like an option to disable the on-screen visualizations of my swipes (along with the accompanying arrows). I think they distract a little bit from the visuals of the game itself. They're helpful when a player first starts, but I quickly found I didn't want/need them anymore.","I definitely DON'T want to give a great game like this a poor review. It's been excellent so far... A little too good unfortunately. What I'm trying to say is that due to the amount of time I've played it, the \"PAUSE, REWIND, RESTART\" buttons have burnt into my screen. The good news is that I was able to fix and get rid of the burn-in. The bad news is that I don't feel safe playing this game. Hopefully a future update will solve this problem somehow...","The most clever and best puzzle game ever. Makes you feel like a genius for solving it each and every puzzle. Each puzzle is masterfully crafted and many have multiple solutions allowing for the player to be as creative as possible.","This is such a great puzzle game.

My only critique is that I could have played on and on, so more chapters in those would have been great. This one is the most challenging yet. I loved the map room and all the different levels just in that chapter. Great entertainment for hours on end.","So intricate, so riveting! This game is so well done! It is in depth with an amazing mind for detail and even the passive scenes and objects are super intricate and detailed. The developers are amazing and I will gladly pay the few bucks to keep these people creating more. So worth it.

I'm sooo happy whenever quality paid games like this come out on mobile. However, the save mechanics are awful. The game is mostly a dungeon crawler rpg like Chrono Trigger. If you save you must quit. And if you quit while in a dungeon you have to start at the entrance the next time you play. The game saves the enemies you beat at least, but you still have to walk all the way back to where you were. Very annoying for a mobile game that people want to play in spurts.","100% WORTH $10! Excellent turn based RPG. GREAT graphics, a really cool battle system that has plenty of depth which adds to the replayability. Great character customization. Multiple characters that would make you want to play through it again with different team combos. New Game+ is the icing on the cake when there is already enough incentive to play multiple times. I've played 200+ hours and I'm just about to start my 1st New Game+. I also haven't used 3 of the 6 characters yet as well!","This game is great. I never imagined I would play a mobile game this much. It reminds me alot of FF games in the past but this game cuts no corners. Deep and good story, expansive combat mechanics and character progression and wonderful voice acting. Thumbs up for this game I hope a sequal is in the works.","You get 6 very different, but well balanced heroes and build an active team of 3 heroes. It takes some strategy to build a good team, but there are multiple good combinations. The team can be changed in town or before dungeons. Heroes have active skills that cost mana, active skills that cost no mana and passive skills. Fights are turn-based, but the order can change, based on speed of attacks and buffs/debuffs. Passive skills have to be selected, active skills become available with your level.","Overall fantastic RPG. Multiple characters with unique abilities that can each be catered to your own playstyle. Has all the classic rpg progression elements, but more satisfying than just a health or damage increase. It's more linear than most rpgs (since it doesnt pack 50 side quests on you in every new area), but theres still a good amount of exploration and quests. My only complaints are that traversal speed is a little slow in dungeons, and framerate is choppy for the first hour of playing."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.hg.bcnw","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hg.bcnw&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Kingdom Rush Vengeance  - Tower Defense Game","description":"Get ready to jump into action and show the Kingdom who’s the real boss in the best tower defense game 2020! \r\n\r\nFace empires of mighty enemies.

When i first got this game it seemed a little weird because It was a little slow but then I got used to it and now I love it. They replaced using your stars to buy stuff to getting souls and you can upgrade a bunch of things. And sadly they removed the feature to use the book to look what types of enimes there are. But other than that you should definitely buy this game. Super fun.","The free games from ironhide are better then this, i dont recommend, you cannot choose the game speed which makes it annoying, so basically you play on slow mode, the cash you get from killing enemies on each lvl.is too low to properly upgrade towers on time so normal lvl is actually difficult to pass with 3 stars, only have 3 free heroes while the free games you get the least the option to get free 6 heroes...other ironhide games outclass this...","Unfortunately I can't refund anymore, but after giving it a hard play I just give up. This should be a free to play game since there's blatant ftp mechanics. Locked heroes, towers, and abilities. This is grotesquely greedy. The levels aren't very well designed and the heroes are even worse, such as the free ranger character. You have to force a RANGED hero into melee to use their strongest ability. The other heros and towers should be unlockable through gems like previous games, awful pay to win","It's unacceptably buggy. On a modern phone (S10+) it refuses to open and gets stuck on black screen half the time, and now SFX sound completely died and does not work anymore no matter what I do. The animations and game as a whole feels choppier and less smooth than the previous ones. Same gameplay, but the overall experience is significantly inferior. Not to mention it's way more in your face with all the microtransactions.","KR has always been special I've been paying since before they came to mobile, this installment in great I love the variety of towers and your ability to customize your loadout is sick. There's a bunch of towers and heros that I think would be really cool to be able to trial run/test for free before committing to buying, I think it would help me make the jump to potentially getting them permanently. Also I miss the encyclopedia out was just really cool to be able to see the whole worlds stats."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.ironhidegames.android.kingdomrush4","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ironhidegames.android.kingdomrush4&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Infinite Flight - Flight Simulator","description":"Infinite Flight offers the most comprehensive flight simulation experience on mobile devices, whether you are a curious novice or a decorated pilot.

Physics are good, Flight models are nice, sounds are awesome, But that's not that it. The staff and the community are amazing! I am having a problem and it got fixed in a span of 20 minutes, totally worth buying the subscription! 10/10., Keep up the great work, Infinite Flight!","Good simulator overall, but there seems to be some visual glitches on my device, such as in the 757, where in the wingview, you can see the speed break mechanism and this is only fixed if I move the camera angle to a specific place. Also, at some airports (KMEV), you can't even takeoff on the north runways because it will say you're outside the region, but when looking the map, it shows there's still a little distance before the border.","Very well made game learnable controIs I understand of the subscription and and yes,the developer provided the best gameplay features and graphics in it for us to experience I've been using it for months and I'm very impressed of how it resulted you deserve more supports in order to provide more features (that will come up with an update) to experience and continue further development. Usually all the features gameplay and graphics that it features/includes are enough for everyone to experience","Very good game, but l have a little bit of feedback. Like maybe you could make free version of online flying and not pro, and maybe you could add a bit more locations on the map to choose from. Otherwise it is a Very very good game l totally recommend buying it. 👌🏻","Edit: Thanks for the response. As far as the liveries for aircrafts. I thought I had seen some already, but they had disappeared when I reached grade 2. And any chance to add an afterburner take offs? Definitely one of the better Flight Simulator games to play. It's nice that they offer alot of planes, although I have noticed some airlines are missing on certain aircrafts."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.fds.infiniteflight","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fds.infiniteflight&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"RFS - Real Flight Simulator","description":"*** Special discounted Price! ***\r\n\r\nLive a unique experience flying in any part of the world and exploring sceneries and airports in high resolution with satellite maps, 3D buildings, runways, procedures and air traffic.

For example, when flying at night, the graphics aren't as they would be where you can see for instance, street lights and high rise buildings. If those features were updated into the next version, that would be so pleasing and relaxing!","The gameplay and graphics is really good and I love how taxing has improved by showing a yellow sign where the destination bay is and you can follow the map knowing where your destination is. Before taxing was harder because you had to follow a map which wasn't as clear and not knowing where the destination bay is. This game has inspired me to become a future pilot. I didn't give 5 stars because the subscription is what let's it down, you don't get enough aircraft in the free version.","Hey Rortos, you're doing a great job for this game. This game is one of the best mobile simulator game. But my issue is there is only three aircraft for if you want to enjoy this game with its all features then you have to buy the Pro subscription and it's okay. I know all developers need money to make their game better. But the game gets boring to play if you don't buy the subscription. I would like if you give one more long haul aircraft for free to play world wide.","Wow really like this sim. It has a wide selection of planes you wish to have in other simulators. But I wish some small airports had aprons. You have to takeoff the runway and I feel my experience is not complete. I'm still going to keep hoping that one day the developers will add aprons in small airports.","There is this bug in the game where it gets stuck on Dataset No.2, and the game won't load. I need to delete it and re-install it just to run the game, and that takes about 45 minutes. Is it possible you patch this in an update? Also, the game is amazing on graphics and phisics. Just this one bug is a problem for me."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"it.rortos.realflightsimulator","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.rortos.realflightsimulator&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Toca Boo","description":"BOO! \r\nDid I scare you!?

Ngl this game wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I wasted my money for this game?! At least make it free. So that we won't waste our money for this. And what I meant by \"this game is actually really good\" is for the under 6 years old kids. This used to be my dream game since im 6 years old.

Will answer a question and it freezes, won't move on. The guess and grab game has never worked. The questions that people put into the game are terrible- spelling and grammar errors make it hard to figure out answers sometimes. They should have someone check the questions (also to see if the question is correct) before they go live. Wish I never wasted my money","Using the paid version. I see that the game allows for users to create questions... there is zero regulation on spelling, grammar, and even correct answers. I see questions constantly that are poorly submitted. Also, TOO MANY ADS remain on the paid version, prompts to buy packages... unnecessary. Overall, daily challenges far too difficult to finish, would take you all day. This game used to be fun... now it's unregulated and cheap.","The questions have become so hard in triviatopics. That coupled with less time makes it no longer fun, but instead stressful. Still getting errors and it taking my turns away. Android users don't have the same in-game functions as iOS users. Can't get enough cookies to keep your pet alive, so I quit even opening the \"gift\".","Suggestions: - Decrease the probability of getting lives in the wheel. - Add new cards or something for the gems, and either make it easier to get/win cookies or remove the pet altogether.","I would give it zero stars but since I can't I will give it one star because since their many new updates it just doesn't work anymore.

The game really isn't as exciting as some of the other Monopoly games I've played (Monopoly Bingo & the board game itself). I would suggest more ways to get rolls on the monopoly board, better UI, achievement goals/more challenges. Right now the game has been kind of a bore. I would definitely wait for an update or two.","Really liked this game at first. Silly there is a max of 10 matches you can play against others. After having this game for a week or two, now it sames the matches and the practice are broken. I've uninstalled and reinstalled and it's still broken.","I like Monopoly and I like Soduku so I thought this was the game for me, I was wrong. The soduku puzzles are either way too easy or way too hard, no inbetween. The \"Monopoly\" part is minimal, pretty much in name only. Should be a free game, don't waste your money.","As much as I enjoy playing sudoku which works perfectly okay in this game. I don't like this game overall. Because this game is not just about playing the sudoku. It's the quest, the monopoly board, the competition, the avatars, etc which is very bad. And the worst of all is that the UI in this game is a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! Don't get the wrong idea. I love Hasbro and Monopoly! I hope the developers of this game don't turn a blind eye on this and ruin the name. Sorry I had to say it! Thank you!","Enjoying the game, but my one gripe is all the collections to be done after each round and then after the whole season. Each area to be collected before you can continue playing. I would suggest a result summary with one collection to be able to get back to playing much faster. When I open the game and see all the collections to be done I sometimes lose interest and close the app."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.marmalade.monopolysudoku","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marmalade.monopolysudoku&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy","description":"A game I made\r\nFor a certain kind of person\r\n\r\nTo hurt them.\r\n\r\nGetting Over It with Bennett Foddy is a punishing climbing game, a homage to Jazzuo's 2002 B-Game classic 'Sexy Hiking'.

The game is intentionally hard with purposely bad controls. Also the game is very possible. I have beat this game on mobile 25 times and 7 on pc. Both versions are the same mountain with mobile being harder, but still possible. Took me 8hrs to beat my first time, and now I average 13min.","It tests your patience, people with high levels of patience can only play this... I'm in love with getting over it...

It says a lot bout life as well...","Hell of a lot easier on PC! Devs listen with no updates how can you provide the best gaming experience! No update means the app can not perform as needed with the new technologies and updates!

No updates, no leadearboards, no boosts, this game falls short in today's gaming world. Last updated 9 months ago!","Is this game worth $5? Nope. My biggest complaint is that the controls are terrible. Granted it's a mobile game so you shouldn't expect much anyway, but it's extremely frustrating to get past certain parts only to get launched in the opposite direction because the controls are either unresponsive or over sensitive. The only plus side is that this game is free with the play pass so you don't have to waste your money to try it out if you have that."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.noodlecake.gettingoverit","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.gettingoverit&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Assassin's Creed Identity","description":"* Requires an online connection to play.\r\n\r\nPlay now the first ACTION RPG game of the acclaimed ASSASSIN’S CREED Franchise. \r\nExplore the ITALIAN RENAISSANCE through the eyes of your OWN ASSASSIN, complete dozens of missions and unravel the epic mystery of The Crows.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THEY SAID ABOUT US:\r\n• “the graphics look spectacular” cnet.com\r\n• “a proper bonafide Assassin’s Creed game” pocketgamer\r\n• “gorgeous graphics” phonearena.com\r\n\r\n\r\nCREATE, EVOLVE AND CUSTOMIZE YOUR ASSASSIN!\r\n- Pick a CLASS: Choose between Berserker, Shadow Blade, Trickster and Thief\r\n- CUSTOMIZE your Assassins: Use loot, choose your outfits and weapons like epic swords and the iconic hidden blade.\r\n- Make your Assassin EVOLVE from NOVICE to MASTER! \r\n\r\n\r\nTONS OF MISSIONS AND POSSIBILITIES!\r\n\r\n- Experience the FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT: Run, jump, climb and feel the thrill of the leap of faith on your mobile screen!\r\n- Achieve an infinity of QUESTS, unlock new locations and hundreds of items.\r\n- PLAY HOW YOU WANT TO with simple tap-to-move, dual virtual stick controls or with a gamepad.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE OF THE ASSASSIN'S CREED GAMES!\r\n- The Unity game engine brings STUNNING GRAPHICS through amazing custom-made HD textures, shaders, and models to your screen.\r\n- Every place you visit in the ITALIAN RENAISSANCE will be an open map for you to explore: Santa Croce Area in Firenze, the Colosseum area in Roma etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n**ASSASSIN’S CREED** is one of the most popular franchise of all time.

But I'll be giving a 4 star for now because of the controls. Hopefully you'll be able to add an option to customize the controls and remove the auto wall climbing and jumping, but instead, make a jump button to make the game more challenging. Also you can add some cinematics for the campaign mode. And kindly add more haystacks specially near high towers and make us do more leap of faith. But overall it was a good game one of the best mobile game ever 👏","Best game AC mobile, the control is good enough when we are used to playing it. Good graphics, unlimited missions make the game not dead. the control is good enough when we are used to playing it. But please add new content that is more like the outfit. I want to get like edward's outfit or aguilar's outfit, but now in the shop, there is not any. Please update the game, sometimes the game got some error when it load menu or when sync the game.","This game is super fun I liked alot, I have every other assassin's Creed game you can buy for play station. I dumped alot ofoney into this game, just today I spent almost fifty dollars and then I downloaded it on my tablet to play on a larger screen and it deleted all my progress and spendings I want to swear right now I'm so upset, why is my saved progression not transfered?? I didnt delete the game just downloaded it on another system. I won't change rating till this is fixed, or my money back","Excellent translation of the Assassin's Creed experience to mobile. A bit aged as of today, but the thrill of creating your own assassin makes for a reasonably memorable experience. This is all, however, hindered by a lack of a proper progression save- once you delete the app, you lose all your data including your purchases; I learned this the hard way...","I'm sure this game was good at the time but it's just boring and I've seen cheap ripoffs of assassin creed with more mechanics the problem with this game is the missions are too simple, very few missions and there are rip offs that are better than this if you guys made a more up to modern standards app game I would buy that in a heartbeat"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.ubisoft.assassinscreed.identity","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubisoft.assassinscreed.identity&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Farming Simulator 18","description":"Become a modern farmer in Farming Simulator 18!

I wish you could color the trailers make your own farm and place buildings like sheds. I wish you could go in cab/ first person view or walk around your farm. I would like more jobs. I hope you guys can make this happen.","I'm a bit disappointed. Great series of the Farming Simulator. Also great & nice graphics and more possibilities that in FS16. However, the Map is the most negative point for me. More Quadratic, hardcore U.S. Western Style with a field also middle in a town. But the worse thing for me, it's dead. No passing cars, Oregon Trek, Coyote and Roadrunner or even the Amtrak Train (despite standing on the Station) on the map moving. This makes it quite dead and lonely the game.","I love all of the farming simulator games! They are such a good time killer. But they need to do more with the maps, and they could add more vehicles. Other than that they are great games and I really advise you to download them and try them out if you haven't already. GOOD JOB, GIANTS SOFTWARE!!!!!!","Controls are a bit iffy, but for what you had to work with you made an amazing job! GIANTS even made it with no ads whatsoever! I'm very proud as someone who regularly sees the desktop version blow my mind. but...

Plenty of fun levels, and so many creative ideas that you can bring to life! The puzzles aren't too hard, but two hints are still helpful to have. The controls can be a bit quirky, though, and some levels kind of force you to use wings to get anywhere.

Even if they were to fix that, for some reason, whenever I turn on the game now, it'll black screen for a minute or two, then crash. Fix please!","One of the best games for your phone. The developers updated the game to have better controls, and although the only downside is that at times the movement feels that you're sliding and gliding around, the shooting mechanics are very fun.

I hope you add that into the game :)","I love the game but since I'm on mobile it's not fun to play The controls are hard to use I can't even look behind me! I wanted to see Foxy on the home page! But the game is good over all because, mobile is hard to play on and so I don't mind the fact that it may have bugs or may not have some of the most fun things in the PC and VR versions","Overall the game is excellent just like the PC version only downside is the controls as mentioned by others. Maybe add controller support or a way to connect mouse and keyboard to make the game a little more playable. Other than that love it!","This is a great game I really enjoy playing five nights at Freddy's help wanted on mobile the only thing that I really found different was that it does not have five nights at Freddy's 3 but other than that it is a great game and you should definitely buy this it's it's amazing they did really good putting this on mobile and yeah you should definitely buy this. And I think that if you have like a small device that we can't run a bunch of stuff this might be really laggy so it can be laggy.","Great game! This game and all the other fnaf games (not clones) are very addicting and can kill some time! Absolutely love it ! Tbh I think this franchise should have more games and more merch!

At this point in development I'm pretty sure it won't be ironed out so as long as you don't mind losing progress every couple of play sessions it's ok. Considering the budget, care and passion that was put into the ps1 game you would think square would try to preserve that legacy but I guess not.","The original FF VII on the PSX is an amazing game. The port to Android has been done adequately. However, controls could have been done slightly better and the game does appear to have a few minor bugs. I found that the motorcycle mini-game was unplayable, because of the absurd speed. Any other glitches or bugs are not noteworthy. At least, while running on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A7.","I have now tried 3 phones that all do not support two button simultaneous input. Therefore, I am stuck with Tifa in the gas chamber. I cannot complete the game due to a control issue. Furthermore, cloud save is not working. DEVELOPERS: please add Y+B, Y+A, Y+X functionality to the bumpers and triggers in the gas chamber.

Virtually any issues I have are with the game itself, rather than anything about this particular version of the game; in fact, this might be the definitive way to play FF2. The same issues with FF1 exist here as well: the font and battle menu buttons are rather small, and the virtual thumbstick is difficult for me to move around with. However, those are fairly minor complaints, and the game itself is an excellent port!","It's unfortunate that the jank of the gameplay does get in the way of a good story, interesting characters, music, and world building for a game back 88. Playing that has character builds will help you understand the character growth but it way more janky. You can break this game as easily as it can break you. I can only recommend this game to anyone who has played a souls game, FF fan, elder scrolls to have some fun with the customization of your party.","So far, I've been greatly enjoying the Pixel Remasters of FF1-FF3. Honestly, these are my favorite versions of the games. There's only one problem: no controller support. There is absolutely no excuse not to include this, especially when the Steam ports of the games have it. Please add controller support for the iOS/Android ports ASAP. Thank you.","First time playing FF2. It's a good game. I won't complain about core design decisions as this team had nothing to do with it. I will complain about massive slowdown when you stack buffs, especially Blink, and how status effects against the party are bugged and hit 100% even with defensive gear (like Ribbon) equiped. Huge oversight which drastically demands a shift in play style.","Pros: Graphics look amazing, Mobile is nice but personallly I would've preferred switch, Faithfulness to the original is incredible, gameplay, is very pretty & smooth yet very faithful, Music is outstanding, without doubt, one of the main reason to buy this. Cons: none of the new content from the various remakes to add playability, no face portraits when speaking(minor nitpick), no console release(yet), can feel a bit clunky, diagonal movement is weird."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.square_enix.android_googleplay.FFPR2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.FFPR2&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Door Kickers: Action Squad","description":"Door Kickers: Action Squad is a crazy old school side scroller action game that puts you in the role of a SWAT trooper and sends you to deal with the bad guys in Nowhere City USA.\r\n\r\nChoose your gear, then kick the doors down and face the action.

I really don't know. It's fun, but there are multiple bugs. Sometimes the fire button gets 'stuck, causing me to kill hostages. Sometimes the game doesn't let me jump, and climbing ladders is a pain. Controlers are supported,, but the controls and buttons are set, and they suck. Also, there isn't a pick up button while using a Bluetooth controller. I wouldn't pay money knowing this before buying. Pls fix this game, and then I'll be happy.","I have to say this game is one of the best games I've ever played on the play store. The gunfights feel exciting and keeps you on your toes as you progress. I can't say how well touch controls are since I play with a dualshock ps4 controller, wich works smoothly. I just wish there could be a bit more variety to game modes or maybe customization options for characters, weapons, etc. I think if there were multiplayer here on the mobile version, this game would be perfect on mobile.","This is a mobile game done right. Yes, it is unforgiving, hard at first, but the content is generous, it really feels like a full-blown PC game. No microtransactions or anything, just pure skill and tactics. The fast-paced action might seem like it's not something you would play on the phone, but it just works!

Highly recommend","It's a great game for starters. But, when you get with the game for some time, there is problems. The controls have bug, the shooting have bug and other. I once used recon to be stealthy, but the bug that makes me fail is the shooting one. It shoots bullet with my hand far from the button. And the moving, some time when I breach a door, my character will simply run towards the enemy making me have to push the button. I have slow reflex and when it happened, I didn't even notice it yet.

The story makes it more interesting but unfortunately the levels are too easy. What interested me the most in the first version was not the story but the use of illusions which engaged a player to look for irrational comparing to real world solutions. I think it is still worth the money just to admire the colourful locations but in my opinion I had much more fun with the previous one.","They somehow made a better game than the first one. The story is a lot more comprehensive. The puzzles are not only just as fun, but they found ways to make them relevant to the current piece of the story. The music of the first is great, but it's really just there, playing in the background. This music is part of the story. 10/10, a great experience.","I loved MV1 and bought MV2 without hesitation. It's just as enchanting and captivating and I love to immerse myself in it. Some of the levels seemed too easy and then there were a couple that stumped me for quite a while. Please create MV3.","A stunning, if short, experience just like its predecessor. Definitely trickier in places than the first, which is welcome, although still never truly difficult; there's always just one way to get through a level using all of the tools made available.","As others have already stated, the art is beautiful but the game itself is laughably easy, especially in comparison to the first one.

Touch controls are unintuitive, and you can't play with a controller anymore. All of my progress has been reset, on every single goat simulator game, all my in game trophies, all my goats, everything. The only thing they fixed was the constant crashes, but they broke a lot of other things in the process. It's a 4/5 game, but has 1/5 controls.","Good game till updated. Now mouse and controllers do not work and I am on a Chromebook so now I can't play at ALL. I just suck on the home menu. PLEASE FIX THIS. Sincerely, Michael","I like the game at first and now since you added that new thing from scratch I don't remember but it's called the loading screen now it won't let me open the game and play the game I like the game but I can't play it now so I hope the Creator can fix this because there's a bug and it's not really that funny anymore but considering the fact that it was a good game that I liked and now it's gone and I paid $15 for payday and for the zombie one and that's $15 also in this one too so I feel scammed","The update ruined the game for me. Lost almost all of my goats, and I don't feel like having to go through hoops to get them all again. Controls work decently, but still not the best. I didn't think the update would get rid of all my achievements as well.","Best mobile game ever and I love that you can play offline. But the new update makes it harder to control the goats movement.

After getting the first two pieces of the blueprint it revealed a code that made absolutely no sense at all. First, the code was stupidly long. Two, there's no keypad to put the code into, and three, the \"security clearance levels\" are utter nonsense. Good game until chapter four.","This is an excellent \"escape room\" style game. The art is beautiful, the story is fun and there's a nice mix of different tasks. The difficulty level's on point too, at least for me. It wasn't so easy that I got bored (I actually played it through almost entirely in one sitting on a free afternoon) and not so hard that I was totally frustrated either. I'll be looking out for more games from these guys because I was hooked and pretty sad when I finished it!","Great design, really good looking game. Puzzles are well thought out, make sense, and are just the right level of difficulty. I'm also really happy to support developers who put together a great game, charge a fair price upfront, then don't bother you with ads + constant upsells. If you like escape type games, this is a must have.","Excellent game! I loved the set and the aesthetic. Puzzles are made mostly in steps, making them entertaining yet easy enough. Mechanics seems excellent and I didn't find anything wrong with this game overall. It brought back to memories the times I spent playing Monkey Island. Little advice: maybe improve dialogues? Maybe more ironic? Anyway, I can't wait to play more titles from the Devs! Shout out!","A couple of puzzles with obscure answers, but overall a great game with snappy writing and a good sense of humor. I won't dock it a star for this, but having to backtrack through rooms multiple times gets very tedious. Having the option to jump to a room/area you have discovered via a world map would take much of the headache away."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"co.yakand.agentaapuzzleindisguise","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.yakand.agentaapuzzleindisguise&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Bridge

Usually I don't care about stories in games, but the Portal story is engaging and funny, and this game continues with the same dark humor as the originals.

The work around them is to install mods which as a user I am prone to do so I didn't encounter many problems. Overall based on the HUD and feel of the game it's a improvement from KOTOR I. The game itself has its faults in quality (based on the original release) but it's still a great experience worth trying out.","Excellent game and port on Android mobile for the most part; however, I am experiencing the game breaking bugs (game crashes during the cinematic on Telos shuttle to polar regions). I'm unable to proceed further in the game as a result. I'm hopeful that this bug will be fixed, but in the meantime the game is unplayable.","The game has a bug. The big crashes the game in cut scenes. The only fix for the bug requires you to move some files around in the data files.... but android no longer allows any access to the data files. So it crashes and can't get past a cut scene. In the simpler scenes you can tap past it, but I am stuck on telos... unable to skip past the scene. And I can't disable the scenes because android 11+ if this can be resolved. I will gladly edit this up to 5 stars.","It works great on Samsung A40. Had no problems with cutscenes and since it can be played offline,I do not have to worry about some update ruining the game for me. No saves present anymore... . I do not remember uninstaling the game on a smartphone. Have,I messed up something,or is it a bug...? Played past Narshada.

ForceHealFTW Not working with Blue Stacks Emulator on PC,but okay.","While the game itself is amazing (especially with the restored content mod) the port to mobile causes many glitches. Very frequently the game will crash after watching cutscenes, it's almost random when it occurs and when it doesn't.

The timer counts down at around twice the normal speed (despite saying it's at the same time), and the fruit is thrown extremely fast at the start compared to the more leisurely Fruit Ninja and Fruit Ninja 2. I really wanted to like this, seeing as how I loved the original Fruit Ninja, but the speed issues make this unplayable. It's like they took the original and set it at 2x to 4x the original speed. Don't waste your money.","It was good when I bought this back in 2013 and it's still good nowadays. Only difference I seem to notice is that there's now an XP system, which I vastly prefer over the achievement based unlocks, which I remember being tedious to get. I might check out the other Fruit Ninja games.","This one indeed feels almost like original Fruit Ninja. Almost... there are still no achievement-based blade and dojo unlocks - everything is level-gated. At least it is not bloated with unnecessary minigames, gardens, point shops and whatever else. Going back to achievemnent-lock IMO would be perfect. \"As is\" it's at least pretty close to original game (kinda in-between og and modern variant really)...","The fact that you pay .99 for no ads shouldn't mean that the game play is worse. The time clock is increased in speed as well as the fruit themselves. I will gladly go back to ads to avoid this. Very disappointing.","Awesome game, really took me back. But there's one thing that is not satisfying, the XP system. It feels good to slash like a madman, but doing the same missions to level up and unlock the blades over and over again is just boring, considering there's only 3 game modes available. So basically it'd be really good if there were some other game modes available (bringing mini games would be awesome) or maybe just some kind of events."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.halfbrick.fruitninja","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.halfbrick.fruitninja&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Papa's Burgeria To Go!","description":"Papa's Burgeria is now available to play on the go, with gameplay and controls reimagined for Android phones.

It's still good gameplay!","in term of gameplay, it's a near 1:1 port of the original. meaning no improvements from the ds, the control of the ds is what you get here. the most glaring issue is the camera, you can't rotate it manually and it doesn't follow your movement very well. feels like missed opportunity here.","I originally bought the game to port it to my PS Vita, but sometimes I'd play it on my phone, for starters, the on foot controls are trash, and the buttons are too small, some times I try to brake then jump out of the car pls fix this","The story is good, the dialogues are hilarious and I really enjoy Huang's sarcasm. The thing that I don't like is the controls that feel really weird, it's clunky and slippery at the same time. Driving a motorcycle is pretty impossible. The \"targeting\" system is pretty trashy too, if my enemy is close to a car, Huang shoots the car instead and then explodes if i use automatic weapons, it's pretty annoying bcs you're in the heat of the moment.

The first is that it is highly replayable. It took me months of play before I looked for alternatives. After a short break, I jumped back in and have again been playing it exclusively for months. The second is that it is single player and offline. I commute on public transportation for ~90 minutes each day I work and this is my go-to entertainment.","I actually play this as a legit videogame. Like I would on PC or console and it's such a full game that I wish it was on more systems. I bought some dlc too. If you got a few bucks to spare and like a roguelite just get it already. Watch videos online too. There's deep strategy but you can go as far without worrying about meta might just take a bit longer. It's not easy to die actually but various difficulty level parameters can adjust the challenge to your taste. Get this game.","Amazing game when playing normal or total war modes + good costumes. Roguelike mode is basically find the cheese tactic or die but fun. Then there is story mode which is completely unfair and tedious. Almost requiring you to keep succeeding the same monster until you have one strong enough to advance the story or have good luck and get weak enemy bases to invade all to unlock/improve Luca. The story is good but you end up hating it after having to do the same thing over a dozen times.","So good I've bought it on all platforms. Simple entertainment with many many things to unlock without paywalls. Multiple modes of gameplay where the normal mode is the most in-depth while the others see you play around with different elements or high end unlocks. Great sprites too. Wish there was some better sound effects for the myriad of creatures and heroes.","Highly rated, so I bought it on sale. Long story short, I've now been playing for nine months and can't stop. An incredibly deep game with some complex strategy, but all you have to do is play and you figure things out as you go along. If you're in a hurry to learn then you can go to reddit or the wiki, but those are NOT necessary to progress. Also, this is the way mobile games should be done: base price of the game is cheap, and there are NO ADS! There's a whole bunch of IAP, some cosmetic and some game-related, but none are necessary, in fact I've unlocked many of the items just by playing the game and earning achievements. So, it seems that most IAP is there for impatient players with large wallets. The exception is the reasonably-priced expansions with new game modes: these are nice to have, but the basic game is deep. There is some grinding for devil stones (game currency), but it pays off with unlocks: new abilities, facilities, maps, buffs, and much more. In addition, there's the satisfaction of moving up difficulty levels. Last but not least, the developer is consistently improving the game: adding better features, new content.

It's a little slow with money making but I really love the graphics and the controls are easy which makes the game really fun.

Really annoying considering I paid actual money for the game.","Love the game and all but tried playing for a kouple days now and havent been able to. . . also i dont like when in multiplayer the games freezes up and gets glitchy when about 5 players load in and drive around. . as stated above love the game just wish that kould be resolved and also if we could get more kars in and update the existing kars if possible some are kinda funny looking (lol). . appreciated much as i plan on kontinuing spending on this game and playing it","Game seems cool but not being able to return after going into any kind of settings or car upgrades etc by pushing back button gets annoying quickly. Getting sick of having to close app and restart just to go back to main menu... especially after paying money for the game. fix this issue and it will be worth more stars","Love this game probably the best lowrider game out there for mobile the only thing that I have seen othere people with this problem is an annoying glitch where if you go to the auto dealer or tune your car maybe even go on your profile you can't click the back arrow and you'll be stuck on the screen which really sucks so please fix that","Honestly one of the best mod car games out there you can literally build anny car you want into a lowrider and if they don't have it you can build it from scratch I would really like to see them add a multiplayer function for the hop so you can play online with friends and also a way to sort out where the chat rooms are"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.MontanaGames.Lowriders.Comeback2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.MontanaGames.Lowriders.Comeback2&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Ticket to Ride","description":"CONNECT MORE THAN JUST CITIES!\r\n\r\nSet off with your friends and family to re(discover) Ticket to Ride, the classic boardgame.

I'm so happy it did! Bought this as I have the boardgame. My fav! Excited to try app. When no ones around to play, play solo(against a bot), / against a friend in local mode / anyone in world in online mode. I was bit annoyed at 1st to pay extra after already got boardgame. On seeing graphics & complexity of putting this together, I understand the fee. I wouldnt pay more than £5 App's easier to take on a real train👍 ❤🎟2🚂","Edit: You guys need to tone your AI down a peg. The thing just keeps blocking. It doesn't complete it's own track so as to block you. The game is good but for some reason you have to go to the developer's website to create an account. Another issue is that after purchasing the app you only get 1 map to play. There are more pay walls to get other maps. This seems very unfair and a rip off. Don't get why only one map is allowed especially when you purchase the app. Feeling cheated.","The game is great, but network issues in local games are a huge bummer. We have lost countless games this way, due to poor synchronisation. It's very frustrating to have to stop a game a few turns before knowing the scores.","Our family really enjoys the board game on which this app is based so found it very convenient for fun on the go when we found the app. We've used the pass-and-play mode, online invitation games, and individual and enjoy each. If you enjoy puzzle/strategy games, check this out!","I am really enjoying this game! I love the board games. But hard to pin family down to play it. So when i feel like playing, i can play with others or play with the computer. Both great options! I have not had any issues with glitches or game play. Visually enjoyable & looks & plays just like the board game. Controls were not hard to figure out.

First is that it does take a while for the game to load up on Note 20 Ultra (comparatively to other mobile games) which makes it difficult to quickly get some things done without committing to a full sitting. Second is the game is forced to be rotated on the opposite landscape orientation I'm used to which makes charging and playing a bit uncomfortable.","So far, so good! You can tell they did as much as they could to accommodate the game on this platform. This has War of the Chosen, Alien Rulers a few cosmetic packs and some other updates. You can also tweak the content; not War of the Chosen as that's pretty integral to the experience, but I usually play without Alien Rulers on PC, and they let you turn that off here as well. It has autosaving and cloud saves. It looks OK graphically. The textures are pretty muddy but at this screen size it doesn't stand out much. More importantly, it runs smooth and I haven't had any crashes yet. There are mainly only presets for graphics options; nothing for fine tweaks, so you'll just have to trust Feral there. The UI is flawless, even on a phone screen (I have an S10e). Every action feels deliberate and controlled, I have no complaints there. It takes a bit to start up, unlike typical mobile games, but stage loads are pretty quick. Maps load way faster than on console and comparably to PC. The only complaint I have is that the game doesn't auto-rotate. It's locked to landscape which is fine, but only one side of landscape, which happens to not be the one I usually play games with. I emailed the devs about this and their response was reasonable, at least: they locked the orientation in order to design the UI around screen notches.","Revised review. After a very bumpy start riddled with crashes the team has come through and have given a stable version. Support has been kind. Although GFX can't be compared with the console version, you DO get what you buy: an AAA game, no ADS, no hidden fees and long replayability. The exact same software would've cost me 90 bucks on the console. As long as they fix it up the same way when a driver update comes out in the future, I'm happy.","I put off buying this for a while because of reviewers having technical difficulties -- if you have a good phone, this runs just fine. Completely worth your money. 100% full port of a great game to mobile, saves transferable between mobile and PC (as long as you disable tactical legacy pack on your PC). If you like XCOM 2, just get it.","One plus 7 pro: Great port! runs better on my phone than my gaming PC (when it first released). Load times are quick. Interface is great. But... It closes when the phone is locked, doesn't always save when it does, making this less portable and something you sit down with. Initial boot can be quite slow. Has a unusable graphics settings just teasing me. Would love some form of mod support... But unlikely. FYI does not work in surface duo."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.feralinteractive.xcom2_android","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.feralinteractive.xcom2_android&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Football Manager 2021 Mobile","description":"Make your mark on the beautiful game in FM21 Mobile, the fastest way to achieve footballing greatness.\r\n\r\nFeel the buzz as you effortlessly craft the perfect squad and tactical setup that’s guaranteed to pick up silverware, wherever and whenever you want.

Game boy grAphics but great depth in the game play... Lots of open ended opertunities to strategize escape plans in a slow paced way... At times i feel frustrated because its a slow paced nature.. But still it shines in its strategy and deep game play which get us emersed in to this pixal world with its gta like features 4/5 marks.. Expecting for more features and updates","This game is fun and an AMAZING sequel, it's better than the original. Barely any games are like that! A good tutorial that teaches the player in a story way, fun singleplayer and multiplayer, and super large amounts of XP for achievements. My only problem is sometimes the green arrows don't lead to stairs but lead to the location I should be if I were up/downstairs","This game is definitly worth the 7 dollars! I bought it in april and I am still playing it with friends and challenging them to see who can escape first. The only downside us this doesnt have cross platform even on the same wifi but other than that the games is absolutely worth it! Highly reccomend this one instead of the first escapists.","I'm glad this game was ported to mobile! I like this game a lot because there's so many different things to do. You can spend your time getting good weapons, raising your money, doing favors, or plotting your escape! One thing I would like added is the rest of the prisons from the original game.","I rate it 3 stars only because it wont allow me to use my mobile data or hotspot to play with friends. I hope someone can and will make this change. That would be great.

Literally went to a black screen. Also can't switch between apps as I need for some reason, because the game stops working if I do. Square Enix, please don't let this game fail like some of your other ports (AKA Chrono Trigger). I loved this game as a kid, so don't let me down!","Once again, this is an excellent port of FF3, and especially exciting because we never got the 2D version in the West! Also, once again, my same small gripes with FF1 and FF2 exist here: the font is small, the battle menu buttons are small, and the virtual thumbstick is difficult to move; however, the thumbstick issue becomes a bit more of an annoyance in this game, because you need to use it to move through secret passages. It won't allow you to do that with the (much better) tap controls","This game has some issues with the control scheme, such as an imperfect virtual D-pad and tap controls not working in hidden passages at all. There is also no controller support. Fortunately there is an auto save feature, but it's easy to miss and I did miss it for quite some time. Overall though, the game is extremely good, spectacular music and animations and the gameplay is as good as ever even if there is some rebalancing.","Game crashes often , laggy when moving around and in battle. Take about 2-6 minutes just to take down easy enemies , which only take 1 or 2 hits to defeat 1. But for some strange reason, whenever i fight enemies in the title screen's Beastiary (AR battle) , the battle plays Normally good. No lag , no delay. But whenever the Now Loading starts , when i Load my savefile , it goes back to lag, delays. I can play FF1,2,5 (Old ver), 4(3D) FF Dimension, Brave Exvius no problem , but not this one.","I love the pixel final fantasy games and being able to play ff3 for the first time is a great addition to the collection. I play on a Huawei p8lite(2017) and it runs fine. After the inial loading there can be a bit of stutter but it soon resolves itself. The graphs are great, no issues like the water not loading as seen from other devices so for me it's a perfect experience. The on screen moving takes a bit of practise but overall is not a game spoiler. Also the font is fine. 6hrs in and love it"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.square_enix.android_googleplay.FFPR3","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.FFPR3&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Star Traders: Frontiers","description":"You are the captain of a starship venturing through a massive open universe.

Plenty of depth, and for once I'm actually enjoying the story of a mobile game. No IAPs, no real-life wait times, plenty to do and plenty of strategy and team/ship-building to keep you occupied for a while. Well worth the price, I'd say. Also love that it's still being updated. Honestly, my only desire would be just more of what they're doing- events, storylines, etc and maybe a few more animations and effects for battles to keep the visuals a little more varied. Great game, dev","Liked it so much on mobile, I also bought it for PC. Open universe exploration with lots of depth and strategy. Has an old school RPG feel like Star Frontiers, Traveller, even Star Finder. If anything could make this game EVEN BETTER, it would be the addition of more alien flora and fauna for the exploration aspects. Otherwise, it's worth every cent. Great game devs! 👍","Doesn't hold a candle to it's PC version. The UI is...they did their best I think. Certain aspects are just tough on the eyes and unintuitive. I started on mobile after hearing great things about this game. Switching to PC saved face for the game, before I about forgot about it permanently. Mobile makes a bit more sense now, but a better tutorial is needed.","I love this game. It's well worth the money. I have been playing games since 1982 and in that time I have become rather picky about games because most of them are not good and they come out broken. Well this game is not broken and it's a lot of fun. So coming from an old school gamer that has almost every gaming console made this game is worth your time if your into space RPG games.","Takes a bit more time to get used to than the original, but don't let that discourage you. If you want a space sandbox where you can be a pirate, a trader, an alien monster hunter, or a whole host of others this is it.

I've tried to be patient, but I've waited for them to fix it for almost a month when you could just revert it to it's working state. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL IT WORKS. No matter how good the game is, it doesn't matter when you can't play. I wish I could get a refund.","Game is AMAZING but there are SO many bugs with the shop ui! Half the buttons I'm pressing only highlight and don't register. I find myself having to press each button multiple times to get the click to register, especially with the shop level up. Also there is a really detrimental bug where the pop-up that explains what an ability will do permanently cover up the screen (and my units). Will easily change to 5 star once bugs are fixed.","Currently I just made it to NG+4. I simply can not stay away from this game for too long. It's addicting & rewarding. I read the developers blog post about the reception of SNKRX and I think he makes accurate points about how the game progresses in its current state. I played the game for hours and hours at first, but now I only pick it up periodically. It's so much fun trying to combine units and see what is the most effective. You will have a great time if you decide to give this game a try.","This is by far the most complicated game of snake I've ever enjoyed playing.

Today I went play and it stuck in portrait mode and is not allowing landscape mode. The game is to small to play for me right now.

Max Payne truly is one of the greatest masterpieces from the '00s.

Experiment. This is awkward, but it's very challenging otherwise. This version gives the same thrill as the original. I could not play this on the touchscreen. I connected an xbox controller and it works well.","My review after 6 years from a Galaxy S4. Rating stays the same. Audio bugs are still there just not as bad with S21 Ultra. Still a slight delay on gun sounds. Some sounds play that shouldn't be there and some sounds aren't there at all. Controls are fine to me. You have to customize to get your correct feel. Also to everyone, this is the PC port, not console port. All console versions they lock off an area after you enter. You can go back through the whole map in this version.","Really fun game I use to play it on PS2 and I come back to it and it's still fun and it is compatible with a controller and it is easier also there is a few audio bugs but nothing to noticeable other than that the game is great I'm really glad I bought it","It needs some bugfixes, like the cutscene at the wall, at the beginning of the first level.

I don't know if the recipe's English translation is incorrect in some places, but I cannot progress past this even though I added the correct amount of each ingredient.

Finding out which objects make characters happy enough to talk is a little difficult (especially Guo Shou!!), but overall it is a interesting puzzle game.","I liked the first parts and the effort they put in the animation, the first time I played this I was already in love with the game since ive played similar games before. HOWEVER, when i went to spring tavern in the kitchen, the chef wants me to put all the ingredients together. The recipe book says i have to put 1 mace of soy sauce idk how to get it since the only option I have is 2 mace of soy sauce. Pls. Fix thiss. Thank you in advance.

Most retro games are about making money off of nostalgic nerds, but this is a labor of love, and it shows. I rarely buy anything here, but I have purchased this, as well as D&D Advanced (not as good, incidentally) solely on this game's merit. Highly recommended.","I'm on my 35th hour of playing this game and here is my review. It's and amazing throw back to classic RPGs. Everything about this game is fun and enjoyable. It's fun to grind, complete quests, and finish the story. There's so much content in this little 5 dollar game. If you're big into mobile gaming, and rpgs, this game is for you! Excellent masterpiece!","The humour is above and beyond! I absolutely love this game and the thoughtfulness behind it. Doom & Destiny is one of the best games of its kind I've ever played. It is the title we've yearned for if we wished for or wanted a Final Fantasy game that keeps our guts tickling with laughter. I'm very glad I purchased this game and I encourage others to give it a chance. I'm totally a proud pirate!","Incredible Game. The fact that you get the full game for free is great! It has funny dialog. The mechanics are well crafted and easy to understand for most RPG fans. My gratitude (and a few bucks) to \"the Nerds who mad this\". Thank you","First RPG to hold my interest in years. It's a blend of The Hero Yoshihiko, Monty Python and the best bits of every 90s JRPG you've ever played (but with 90% less grinding). Story was good enough to keep my attention (seriously, at this point it's almost impossible to make me care about evil wizards bent on global domination or magic crystals that control the fate of the world), mechanics were solid, dialogue was always funny and sometimes a little hilarious.

The first is on level 5 of The Phantom Menace, you can't walk down a hall without the game forcing you out of the app and not saving your progress. A new problem I've found is that it just completely wiped an entire game I'd spent roughly 9 hours on. I understand that amount of time is sad, but that's still a awful glitch that needs fixing. I wouldn't expect these mistakes from a free game, let alone one that costs £7.","On \"Retake Theed Palace\" you can't go down the corridor without the game crashing. On \"Through the Jundland Wastes\" and \"Dagobah\", you can't use the turnstiles, you'll just go straight through them. These make the story impossible to complete. There is also the same turnstile issue on \"Jedi Destiny\" which makes it impossible to collect every minikit. Other reviews also complain about the same issues. I was playing on a Samsung Galaxy S21.","Ok, this game is really fun and very addicting. But I will have to say that there are certain glitches on some levels that happen, and you cant complete that certain level, which means you can't complete the levels after it either. But if you are playing just for fun, incredible game. But if you are seriously trying to complete all the levels, then thats tuff.","There is a glitch on level 2 of episode 4. When you're in the jawas mobile home thingy and you're trying to fre C3-P0, the turnstile is there visually but is intangible. This glitch is detrimental to the progress of the game as you cannot move forward and go onto the next level. It basically prevents any 100% of finishing and getting anything else the levels hold. Absolutely terrible. I will play again when this bug is fixed.","In episode 1 level 5 Theed Palace it crashes right after every character stands on a button to open a door and as soon as you walk through the door crash back to home screen. I haven't been able to play any of the other movies yet a bit frustrating since I just paid for the app and cannot get through the first episode. Please fix these bugs that people are giving feedback on. Otherwise it's a wonderful classic game."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.wb.lego.tcs","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.lego.tcs&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"TL Pro","description":"TL Pro - resource loader, which allows:\r\n\r\n1.

I was hesitant about getting it because I thought it was just a ripoff, but it's actually very well made, especially for a mobile game. I feel like at some points though tapping on the screen to run can be difficult and irritating, but with playing the game a second time you should get used to it. Overall, I really enjoyed Very Little Nightmares. 👌","Love this game as well as the original ones. Not quite challenging, but different and it's purely a good mobile game. I can see why some people wouldn't like this one. If you want to know Six's background then play this. I'd like to suggest that maybe we can play by chapter just like the original games? Would be also great for those who have finished the game but want to get the boxes/achievements","I love this game and all the little nightmares games, my only problem is It wont load. When I turn the game on, it brings the mini title of the game and everything turns black,. I waited about an hour for it to load but it didnt. And even sometimes I can see the title faintly flicker over and over again on the black background. I love this game but I cant play it because it wont load... I hope it can be fixed...","Look, I love the Little Nightmares games, but I just can't recommend this one. The controls make most puzzles absolutely impossible unless you know exactly what you're doing, many of the puzzles are already entirely unintuitive, and the new setting and villain designs come off as uninspired compared to those of the main game. I'm sorry, but stick to the main games.","I would've given 5 stars if it weren't for the controls. They are the main problem for this game. You tap and she goes wherever and all that. She also can't run with a key making the room where The Butler is putting clothes in the washers impossible. During downloading, I was excited. Now I'm just disappointed. The other games in the franchise were better."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"eu.bandainamcoent.verylittlenightmares","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.bandainamcoent.verylittlenightmares&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"The House of Da Vinci","description":"Enter The House of Da Vinci, a new must-try 3D puzzle adventure game.

Ripoff of The Room, but inferior in every way. Frustrating mechanics, and puzzles that are often furious tapping to get the thing to move as intended. I found out the hard way that even if you figure out what to do with an object, it won't let you until you have done another thing. So waiting until I felt like I've tried everything before clicking the hint, just to be told I had already tried the right thing earlier... easy choice to uninstall. Don't waste your money.","This game is UNRESPONSIVE. Ive never had to tap, pinch, and swipe so many times to get something to work! Some elements would not work until AFTER using the hint several times in a row. The globe section was not explained properly and I had to look up a solution. Unless it's on sale, do NOT buy, unless on sale. It's beautiful, great music, but the basic elements do not work, making you think something is wrong. The hints do help, but you NEED them in some areas. Good luck. 2.5-3 * for sure!","Great puzzles. Very similar gameplay to The Room series with a slightly better story. My biggest problem and reason for only three stars is that the controls can be very frustrating. The camera often rotates when trying to pull or rotate parts of the puzzle (and other xamera issues). And many areas were so dark they were difficult to see even with full brightness.","Not very intuitive, puzzles seem pretty random...I spent the five dollars, played for the first time for no more than an hour, got bored with the lack of flow and overall randomness of the puzzles and have never played again. Waste of $5, almost immediately uninstalled.","This game was so creative and beautiful, but the controls were frustrating. Movements in some puzzles had to be ridiculously precise, like threading a needle. A few of the puzzles were also quite tedious to solve, with a lot of back and forth and repetitive action. A great game, but needs a little development."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.bluebraingames.thehouseofdavinci","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bluebraingames.thehouseofdavinci&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Farming USA 2","description":"Plow, fertilize, plant and harvest your own crops on 9 different fields across 250 acres.

For some reason it would not transform over but I don't care about that. I have noticed that in the one I have on this phone it rains way too much. I have had multiple game years where my crop is so over saturated that it won't be ready for harvest before I have to plant it again. I'm sorry but weather should be done in 6 hour time limit instead of 12 or give us more days in a month. Harvesting at 40% just so you can plant again is ridiculous.","The graphics might not so good. But the real deal of this game is the realism. It's probably the most realistic, most comprehensive, and most advanced farming simulator on mobile. It even simulate market prices, weather, also ground moisture and how it affects harvest quality. Many realistic-looking vehicles and vehicles physics also feels realistic. The scenery looks kind of beautiful it brings a calm and peaceful countryside vibes. I really love the sunset and sunrise hours in this game. 💯/10","I think u need to do debuging an in multiplayer trailers and trucks and farming equipment start floating in the air and the other player don't see them, and vehicles and trailers and tractors also go invisible need to be fixed as soon as possible And a new update an put new vehicles like Police cars with work police lights Fire trucks working fire trucks lights Mustangs GENERAL LEE Lift kit for trucks an leg under glow an customizations When is farming USA 3 coming out","Love it the game but I think the seasons should be 30 days in one month and there should be a lean mower for only $1,000 there should also be people in single player and cops and a hospital and school and a bigger map and when u have to pick ur first tractor with a loader with dually and dealership like tractor, equipment, vehicles, and lawnmowers, and windy days and when you mowe lawns you get paid $700 and you can also get jobs","Well just overall the game is not that practical. I could get a better game or the same type game and still not have to spend money on literally everything. First off you only get 1 free harvester without having to spend real money and you only get 2 trucks without having to purchase packs it is just stupid we spend 3.99 to install it and like probably $20-25 dollars to get half the stuff we need in the game it is really a waste of money don't try it"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.bowengames.farmingusa2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bowengames.farmingusa2&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Teen Titans GO Figure!","description":"Get ready for Teen Titans Go!

I enjoyed the many creative ways this game constantly changed up from older game styles to messing with who worked on what (if that statement seems to make no sense you will just have to play to find out). The passion and hard work shows very much and I am so glad I gave this a chance when hearing about it. For those who may not like puzzles the in game help is always there to help out. But try your best to solve it.","Absolutely phenomenal. I played the flash version of There is no game years ago and thought it was fun and hilarious.I bought this game and went in with fairly low expectations but this game blew it out the park and was even more fun, hilarious and worth every second of my time. The (not) game is around 5 hours long and each chapter is around 50 minutes long but it is still amazing. Stop looking at reviews and buy the (not) game. Thank you Draw Me A Pixel for such a great game.","Wonderful experience. Amazing voice work, story telling, and puzzles. Highly recommended and worth buying. Only complaint: some interactions with items at the lowest parts of the screen can enable Android's assistant/app switching tools. Easy to get around, but just a little annoying.","After further consideration I think I'll detail and my score doesn't change because all in all it is worth it: The game is great overall, however some sections were just too long (the ending) or repetitive (the F2P one especially). The production however is very good, the concept is brilliant and there is a bit of plot that actually made me sad and a great song relating to it. Pros: + brilliant design + actual decent background story + very respectable soundtrack and overall production Cons: - some parts were too long for their own good, got frustrating Room for further improvement in future games: - make use of mobile sensors for more diverse interactions?","Just like the first non-game it was fun and hilarious, plus an emotional roller-coaster. As the user, i felt truly part of the story and i love this adventure a lot. I hope for more adventures with Game, GiGi and Mr Glitch in the future. Only addition i can suggest is an achievement menu, cos I'm sure I've missed at least something in my 4 playthroughs thus far... said menu would help me complete everything."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.DMAP.Ting_WD","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DMAP.Ting_WD&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Doodle God™","description":"Over 185 Million Players Worldwide!\r\n\r\nUNLEASH YOUR INNER GOD AND CREATE A UNIVERSE\r\n\r\nIn this addictive, ALL ages, puzzle game mix and match different combinations of fire, earth, wind and air to create an entire universe!

I love how long it is. The first time I played it, it took me 34 hours to complete it. There are so many items you can get. Sometimes in games the fights are impossibly tough and you don't level up fast enough. but this one is not the case. I recommend don't level up past LV. 6 before you become a jedi. Also (in my opinion) don't go to tatooine first, the chieftain is very tough.","This game greatly exceeded my expectations. Of course, this is a port and should be reviewed as such, not for the game itself. The gameplay was very smooth and I had minimal issues. The only real problem besides a couple of crashes was that the first caption box would not appear at many times. It breaks the immersion when I have to go back to read the chat logs whenever someone speaks in a language other than Galactic Basic; I shouldn't be annoyed whenever I see a Rodian. Other than that, 10/10.","It it would get 5 stars if the app wasn't broken. Dialogue boxes don't appear which makes the parts in alien languages pretty annoying. characters stand frozen for up to a minute in cut scenes before begining to speak sometimes. And if you do something that makes the game angry you'll need to delete and reinstall. Amazing groundbreaking game, but the app still doesn't work.","I'm gonna be honest, I first played this game on my original Xbox. It honestly feels like it was meant to be played on my phone. It's wild how much better the controls are. I even tested the theory and bought it on my series s. Let me tell you now. Thankfully I got if for free.","Can't believe it's actually available for Android.. crazy. It's a massive download and will take a lot of space.. but it's a good port.. I loved it then, love it now. Although, I forgotten how TOUGH Darth Malak is at the end.. still working on it,😄 15 years ago, he woulda been a few tries at most.. I'm gettin stomped in like, a minute? 2 minutes? 😒😄"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.aspyr.swkotor","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aspyr.swkotor&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Neo Monsters","description":"Form your team and battle for victory!

The game's movement restrictions also make it boring though, I would really wanna see the action like the ultrablaze , there must be actual fire to get the mood going. You also must add more elemental stuff , like I don't see the point of having an ice monster without any ice attacks .But everything else is awesome though, great game","Good game, it's about capturing monsters to add to your collection. Great storyline, great game design. Here's the problems about this game: 1. Gets boring overtime, 2nd time I've deleted it, though I downloaded it again 2.you can get stuck easily, by that you can't do anything anymore, takes a while to actually find something to do. If anyone isnt the dev reading this, 10/10 recommend, not saying it's boring for the devs just, if anyone is looking at the reviews before downloading","Incredibly fun game and definitely worth your time. Reminds me of Monster Farm from back in the day and that`s why I installed it. Mixes old RPGs from the 80s and 90s and throws them into a MMORPG world. Lots of events and rewards with likeable characters who have different story arcs/backgrounds that keep you invested. Collectible monsters are fun, varied, and easy enough to get when it comes to Epics or Mythics. Definitely a grinding game so be sure to have patience; it`ll pay off in the end (Just got my first Mythic). Be sure to collect those Gems and free rewards you`ll find scattered throughout the game; forty equals about a handful of Epics and the possibility of a Mythic (How I got my first). Fun, charming, easy to understand and play, with enough strategy to keep you on your toes. Only Con is the strategy is a bit limited. Highly recommended.","Pay to trivialize. This game embodies pay to win to a different degree of insanity. Not only are you given insane gacha-style rng rolls, you stand 0 chance in combat without a team of \"Mythic\" class monsters. Ranging from, for no reason, dragon and demons to twerking anime girls. No twerking anime girls aren't going to be found as normal monsters. To secure even a single mythic is 25$ for their one time guaranteed roll. Even a single ability on these mythics can beat a whole team. Don't play.","I'll be honest with you, if you're looking for a good monster capture rpg game that has a lot of strategy, good AI battles and PVP in it, this is the game for you. In terms of pay to win, I'm a f2p player and I managed to score rank 200 within a year of playing. One of the best f2p friendly game I've came across, all you need to do is log in atleast 30 minutes a day and you're good, that login time would be worth it too."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.pockettrend.neomonsters","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pockettrend.neomonsters&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Where's My Water?","description":"Get the GAME OF THE YEAR award-winning puzzler!\r\n\r\nHelp Swampy by guiding water to his broken shower.

This has to be one of the best DW games I've had the pleasure of playing, there's secrets, references, connections to real episodes, etc. There are thrills chills and... Some other good words that ryme... But most importantly, it feels like you're taking part in the adventure instead of spectating it! I do hope to see more stuff like this in the future! P.S. The lack of ads is much appreciated.","Honestly one of the best games I have ever played, (and I'm an avid gamer) This was phenomenal and everything I could have dreamed of in a doctor who experience! Beautifully written and well put together. It really pulled me in! Exceeded expectations even considering that the premise was from my favorite episode which made me fall in love with the series. Great job!!! Thank you!","Oh man, what can I say? This was amazing! Definitely unnerving, what with the glitches and all. The concept of anything that holds an image of an Angel becomes an Angel itself makes for a brilliant use of the game taking place on a \"found phone\". Really felt the tension at the end there. Hats off to the developers, the actors, and the composer for such great music, especially the theme! If you guys are able, make more in this style. We'll done guys, brilliant! And remember: Don't Blink","Honestly, this was a lot of fun. I've played a few games in this style before, but this one being basically a full-blown Doctor Who episode, and not just that, but a direct sequel to the first and best Angels episode outweighed any tire i might have towards the format.","All Doctor Who fans will really enjoy this extension of the episode Blink. The found phone format works really well and the game moves at a good pace while keeping your interest. Puzzles are easy and just add to the story line moving along nicely. The scenes with the angels, while not particularly scary, are well done. The best part is the authenticity. Fans will love that original actors are featured and the little things only fans would know. Osgood was great! Well worth the 3 hour play."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.mazetheory.dwla","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mazetheory.dwla&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Rusted Warfare - RTS

Fantasy Violence","adSupported":false,"released":"Dec 31, 2011","updated":1614049308000,"version":"1.14.h3","recentChanges":"= Rusted Warfare v1.14 Hotfix 3 =<br>-Fix crashes on android 11

renderer","comments":["This is my favorite game. No ads, no in-game purchases, just good, clean strategy and tactics! Would love to be able to setup specific routes for units, so I don't have to micro-manage movements. Also, different battle modes (like recon, defend-only or attack) would reduce micro-managing by providing better control of when units engage the enemy.","So let me start this by saying there is a learning curve. When I first started playing, I was so bad I thought people in the multiplayer were hacking. They weren't however, now that I know the pacing of multiplayer I can compete and often win. Such a refreshing experience as it's about strategy not paying to win. Not many English players, but multiplayer has universal pings so teamwork is still easy. Great Job to the Devs and well worth the money.","Running very smoothly on my android 11 device. As an old school CnC player, It is a little better than i was expecting it to be, and is in some ways an improvement upon similar type PC games that were available in the late 90s / early 2000s. The AI although somewhat predictable after a couple rounds, doesnt always make the same move and has kept me busy so far. Adding a random element would break things up in a good way. ( random nuke , asteroid impact, weather, stealth units )","Really well made game, I absolutely love it. It gives an incredible nostalgic feel of old style PC games fitting right in your pocket, while also trying to be its own game and style. Definitely worth the two euro I paid for it, never spent a more worthwhile two euro in my life.","Buy it enjoy. Okay all troops are drones so if you have kids there's no blood just explosions. Troops range from small scouts to Modular spiders which is something like the Scarab from Halo. It has multiplayer but that's not my thing anymore. You can choose the troop limit for skirmish, but performance seems like it might be an issue if you have a device with limited memory. I have a ton more to say and could give a much better review but there's a silly character limit.

BUT we have a huge problem now which is the sound. It's cracking when i run or even walk through the towns. I mean Every towns. It's getting worse because the sound is cracking even outside the towns especially in mt. Celion and in ruins of Zalam. It's such a shame because the sound is really relaxing and fits the gameplay perfectly. Please fix the sound so i'll turn it back to 5 stars. Thank you in advance! :D","Great game but the sound issues of distortion on my galaxy note 10 plus is absolutely killing me! There is no options to muck around with to even help it out! There is also nothing wrong with my speaker so the only fault I can see is in the software! Please fix it considering you charged me $30!","I've had this game for a year or so now, it's soo Boss and I'm absolutely convinced Capcom updated the graphics again. The landscapes are big and epic, it's a dragon RPG simulator that will give you 100+ hours if you just play it. The multiplayer isn't up anymore, but I see that as a good thing since the download size is 1.8g now. It's used to be twice the size so it's a big win in my opinion. This game does everything any top rated RPG would do but without the anxiety.","As a big mhw and jrpg fan this game won me over coz it's the perfect blend from the two genres. Awesome graphics, good story, strategic combat and u can collect monsters..how exciting is that!! Best premium mobile game and no BS microtransactions.","Love the game itself, the item system and the Pokemon-esque battle sequences, but there is a very game-breaking bug that keeps happening. For instance, I had purchased a Rathian Horn weapon and a Nerscylla armor set, and saved multiple times after doing so. Yet when I exited and re-entered the game, my previously bought equipment had completely dissappeared. My main quest progress was still the same from my last save when I still had it.

It also includes new weapons, a new perk and trait, new customization options, and more!<br><br>Also includes minor improvements and bug fixes.","comments":["LOVE this game. It lives rent free in my head. The graphics, the little story lines, the characters its all really awesome and fun to figure out. I did have difficulty with controls, I found the character goes every which way if you don't pay attention to where your thumb is, I also wouldn't mind if characters could get backpacks to hold more than 3 things at the same time! Otherwise awesome game.","The game is really fun and it's very engaging because of the randomness. The main issue I have with it is the fact that it keeps crashing unless I have internet connection. I feel like this ruins the point of it being an offline game which sucks. Please fix this as soon as possible, I would've rated it 5 starts if it weren't for this issue. Thank you","I want to say the game is fun it's similar to pc version without cutting any content wich is good, but the problem is the control. I want say that PLEASE make the control is like a twin-stick game because it should be. the movement button is visible and fixed, added separate attack button not just tapping the entire screen to attack, and the last is please add option for resizing the button. Thats it for me if the game control has been Fix i will give 5 star :)","I've played game 200+ times and still haven't beaten it. I really suck, but the game doesn't, so get it now! edit: the latest update, (June 18, i think) caused the return of the \"need wifi to play\" issue. Ruined the whole \"play while you're bored offline\" deal. This has been patched before, so I don't know why it has come back.","Holy hell. The control in this game is the worst without having to spend money on a Bluetooth controller. Your in game controls should at least be playable, but nooooo. It gives me a migraine to complete the most simplest of movements. Don't tell people to buy a controller instead of fixing the actual problem. This game is unplayable as it stands."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.noodlecake.drtc","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noodlecake.drtc&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Forest Camp Story","description":"The great outdoors are calling!

It seems that rivers only increase the stats of things when they are SouthWest or SouthEast of the river tile. And anything NorthWest and NorthEast will actually get a SEVERE penalty to its stats. Nothing is stated that rivers are supposed to do this and everywhere I look it's just says that rivers are supposed to improve the general vicinity. Is this a bug? Or is this an intended feature of rivers to buff one side and nerf the other.","This game has a lot of different variables. I like how they branched out by having users run the store at the same time as the camp. This game is kinder to you with spare finances and achievements that dish out regularly. Even still, progress and rewards felt too easy and too slow I love the graphics and traditional Kairosoft feeling I got with the game. It felt a little stale early on as it became difficult to think of how to optimize my camp layout without going bankrupt.","Another masterpiece. The game slowly lets you in on all the features over time. It does get grindy from B rank omwards when you will have to focus on expanding.","Brilliant game, really enjoyable.

The controls were quite good, but they eventually became really glitchy after a month of playing.

And despite not having much quantity in the way of story, it's very effective at telling that story with only a little exposition, and a lot of environmental and game mechanics cues. I \"finished\" it once today, now I'm looking to see if this has reset mechanics or multiple endings or what. 👍👍","I usually rate games when I enjoy them as I don't like to give negative reviews for any hard work developing a new game. I've tried to like it. I've spent a long time clicking on and reading very basic details. I read the very positive reviews before paying and playing and would really like to know if the reviews are genuine. I was bored. Sorry.","This game is amazing, a lot of mystery and each person will have their own experience. Trust me this isn't a fake bot review, I actually spent money on this game and I do not regret it. I love it a lot and the simple look gives it charm and stands out. The story can be easy to miss (ik cuz I did) I recommend not rushing through it and take your time to read every encounter, and interaction. I won't spoil any story or anything. Just buy it if you have the money and play it how you want to.","This game is incredible. I've played through the original website version multiple times since I first found it, around 2014. I just got around to playing this version. I expected it to be the same (which is what I wanted), but it added so much more to the \"story,\" giving even more feelings of uncertainty (in a good way). New nuances create more concise feeling of discomfort, creepiness, sadness, regret (again, in a good way). $1.99 is a very low cost for this experience, to say the very least.","This game isnt for the casual game player it is a deep experience with lots of good story elements. The game is great, challenging, and interesting. Just wait till you unravel the whole story of you and this dark room. Of any game on my phone this one is the best it has roughly 5 hours (if you play it non stop) of game play.

Have fun.","This is one the the best mobile rpgs out there and it is a shining example of how to do classic games on a mobile device. The music is good, the gameplay and controls are well suited for mobile, and the added quick save function is genius. If you only play 1 jrpg on mobile, make it this one.","Game is very basic rpg based on classic NES title of the same name. This particular version is a port of the GBA remake or something so it looks better than the original but still plays basically the same. Some of the monster and item names are different for some reason. A well made game but simplistic and beating it takes only about 6 hours if you go ham. A great diversion for 3$.","It's Dragon Warrior from the 8 bit NES ported to Android. A few changes of course to the monster names which naturally of course adds the Dragon Quest cheesiness which I didn't care for, and the key items are obvious sparkling spots on the ground that take no effort whatsoever to find. Certain mobs award more gold than normal to 8 bit NES, and low-level monsters seem to do less damage. Magician appear near Kol but not Garinham...etc Still very playable for a game that's 35 years old.","I've always loved the game. But it's ruined by the inability to play in landscape.

This is definitely worth paying for considering you never get interrupted by annoying ads, and in game purchases are 100% optional unlike some games where you just can't progress without $5 every day.

One thing that was annoying; how some of the stages paths were jumbled and you wouldn't know which path to upgrade. It did add a bit of a challenge, which is good for any game worth dL-ing, but as I said, it was annoying. It'd be nice if there was a \"5 more waves\" option to buy with the leftover stars. On some stages, right when it gets really interesting, it's over. Good game overall.","Ok, so this game is basically the origin story of the first 2 games in the series (KR and Frontiers). It stayed close to the other's artstyle (which I really love) and created a really deep and interesting story. I sort of don't like the gameplay, since they switched up the towers mechanics a bit, but that's just me being picky. I'm sure you will love it just as much as I did. Oh and since people don't seem to get it: it's not pay to win. You will undeniably lose sometimes. But don't give up!","I never really got into the tower defense genre, but this completely changed my mind. It's very engaging, well thought out, just the right balance of challenge and reward. You really get the sense that your strategy worked when everything goes smooth. The heroes are also nice to upgrade and to play around with different styles of combat. The levels are a sight to behold and enemy types keep on changing appearances which keeps everything fresh.","I was a bit hesitant to try this, but it was 100% worth it. Great levels that balance enjoyment and difficulty, creative enemies and bosses, and post-game campaigns that are not only enjoyable, but require skill. I've seen a lot of one star reviews for this, but all of them are made by people who are outraged they have to make a choice to not buy extra heroes. Great game, excited for Legends. 😘","This is the first Kingdom Rush I played that I actually stopped playing and deleted it. Who thought it was a good idea to have levels change up the path halfway through? Or allow people to go other routes of nowhere? I get you're trying to make it different but for me personally this makes the gameplay infuriating and not fun. I worked for 12 level and now everyone can pretty much bypass the defenses? How is that fun???"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.ironhidegames.android.kingdomrushorigins","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ironhidegames.android.kingdomrushorigins&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Rusty Lake: Roots","description":"James Vanderboom's life drastically changes when he plants a special seed in the garden of the house he has inherited.

The story has a lot of depth to it and you really get to know the whole weird and creepy family and their history. The levels have perfectly macabre puzzles that can be challenging but completely solvable without needing a walk through guide. There are a lot of branches in their family tree so you get a fair amount of playtime making it a worthwhile purchase.","What can i say. I am just sad i played this last from the whole series since i couldn't purchase it earlier. Incredible story and aesthetics making sense of the other installations lore. Very nice little puzzles especially the 1 with the pidgeons. Keep the good work guys and deliver more awesome and cool freaky stuff :D","A good game overall. The puzzles are short and sweet which is nice but can feel unsatisfyingly short. The last few were quite buggy. The final puzzle gives you a hint after you've solved it (making it impossible to solve) so the ending is just frustrating.","This was a great change of pace from the other games with multiple avenues to explore all culminating in such a twist. Great game!","This game is something... It's wicked, challenging, interesting, heartbreaking at times, and it's really hard to put it down once you start. I absolutely loved every bit of it, from amazing graphics and very distinctive style, through interesting puzzles, all the way to the twisted story that leaves you wanting more. I'm actually downloading other games from this developer as we speak. Don't think too much, buy this game... It will be well worth your money!"],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"air.com.RustyLake.RustyLakeRoots","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.RustyLake.RustyLakeRoots&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Dungeon Defense","description":"I have created a Google community.\r\nI hope you can share information about the game through the Google community.\r\n\r\nhttps://plus.google.com/communities/110768992708471939219\r\n\r\n* If you're having trouble with the screen not touching, please disable the screen-related app.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefeat all invaders to defend your dungeon!\r\nCollect more weapons and monsters to make them stronger.\r\nEnjoy various contents such as \"dungeon building, collect various weapons, achievements\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to defend the last remaining dungeon of this world, you became a guardian.\r\nHeroes from all over the world gather to conquer the dungeon.\r\nNever be defeated, be the best dungeon!\r\n\r\n\r\n◈ Enjoy \"Retro graphics & Sounds\".\r\n◈ Easy to play, anyone can enjoy it easily.\r\n◈ Please enjoy the pleasure by sweeping away enemies.\r\n◈ Organize a variety of mercenaries and find synergies.\r\n◈ Rewards are waiting for each achievement.\r\n\r\nI am a solo developer.\r\nYour download and feedback is so precious to me.\r\nIf you have fun, please recommend it to the people around you.\r\n\r\nAndroid.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\r\nAndroid.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\r\nTwo permissions are requested for the management of save data.\r\n\r\nandroid.permission.INTERNET\r\ncom.android.vending.BILLING\r\ncom.sec.android.iap.permission.BILLING\r\nInternet access is required for Google Play services (leaderboards, achievements)\r\nYou will also be asked for permission to make payments.\r\n\r\n@ GameCoaster","descriptionHTML":"I have created a Google community.<br>I hope you can share information about the game through the Google community.<br><br>https://plus.google.com/communities/110768992708471939219<br><br>* If you&#39;re having trouble with the screen not touching, please disable the screen-related app.<br><br><br>Defeat all invaders to defend your dungeon!<br>Collect more weapons and monsters to make them stronger.<br>Enjoy various contents such as &quot;dungeon building, collect various weapons, achievements&quot;<br><br><br>In order to defend the last remaining dungeon of this world, you became a guardian.<br>Heroes from all over the world gather to conquer the dungeon.<br>Never be defeated, be the best dungeon!<br><br><br>◈ Enjoy &quot;Retro graphics &amp;

Addicting/Dopamine-inducing gamification scheme with no real point. As other said, it is mostly trivial stuff, then a soft, then a hard barrier. Rinse and repeat. Might as well install a pure autoclicker and sit in front of it all day.","An addicting game, but it has a problem that really drags it down. I rarely play a game, especially a mobile game, for an extended. Of time in one sitting, but I played this one for hours nonstop. Got past day 600 and could have kept going, but it seemed inefficient, so I reincarnated and spent my crystals on some upgrades, but they're not going to help much. It will take a literal days to get through the trivial content I already finished and to get back to where I was. Very tedious.","Fun, (relatively) simple game that gets you going for the first few hours. At first it seems perfect, but after grinding for ~10h (I kid you not), you realise that the benefits of the grid pale in comparison to the time spent. The initial ramp up of upgrades and items is quickly dwindled by the subtle push to reset your run (\"rebirth\") which makes you lose everything except some currency. After ~ 4 resets I barely feel like I've acomplished much. 4/5; only get if you LOVE grind fests.","For a dollar this game is incredible. The animation style is great, the power scaling is fun, the mechanics are entertaining. And as a bonus the music is reminiscent of old 8bit Pokemon, which is hard to emulate well without being cliché.

Easy starts out with more lives and longer power-up times after you eat a Power Pellet.The game even trumps its epicness by allowing you to pick up a fresh game from where you lost. I attached an OG Atari 2600 4 way controller to my tablet, and I have the exact look and feel of the past!","It's a shame the developers don't read these reviews! I just bought this game to enjoy but I can't because there are so many glitches that make the game uneasy to play. I'm having the same issues as everyone else. I'm going to uninstall and move forward with a different game. For those who think of downloading this game, don't! Trust me, It's a waste of time and money!","Great game but the developer for this app \"forgot\" that the power pellets are there to make the ghosts blue and therefore easy to capture and not do anything.","Just sorry they suppose to turn blue when u eat a pallet but it dont its like whats the point in having the game if its not the real thing.","The controls are awful.

This game does NOT load with any selected presets. It's fine if you want a strict vanilla game, but if you are used to tweaking the settings, this port is NOT for you. In addition, don't be mislead by that \"refund\" button and assume that you can request a refund if the game didn't work right. When you click it, it just says \"refunds are against store policy.\" EDIT: the store did allow a refund the second time I tried it...maybe you need to leave a review?","I used to love this game but lately the developers have been slacking on fixing bugs and updates. I've been having the same problem I see some other people are where my presets aren't being applied and the changes I made to my world just aren't there once I start playing. This really kills the game for me and I probably won't be playing until I noticed it's fixed.","I loved this game, but I guess with some of the updates, the preset features absolutely do NOT work. I don't know how many times I have edited the features and when I start playing, hardly any of the choices I picked are displayed in the game. For example, I chose not to have any hounds and when I start playing....low and behold I'm being attacked by hounds. It's not really \"No Sweat\" if you have to fight for your life when you've chosen to play without sweating.","After quality of life update I get serious slowdowns when there is even a few trees on screen. It has to be the update because it worked perfectly before then. I also have shipwrecked and it still works perfectly since it did not receive an update. Please optimize the update. I don't have a very high end phone(samsung galaxy a11) but this game worked just fine before even with my device. Please optimize as this is the game I play the most.","This game just isn't made for mobile, the controls are just too clunky and it makes fighting really difficult. Inventory organisations isn't a thing. Its a decent game concept and it might feel better on pc or console but I'd rather play minecraft on pc or console. I was hoping this game would be the perfect sandbox survival on mobile since it's 2D and the controls should be easier than minecraft pocket edition but the controls are just not good enough.

Such as bringing your bike out of the garage causes the screen to go ballistic in different perspectives. I had to pause the game and resume to fix. I always wish the steering of transport were more sensitive especially during racing. I always had to really dig my finger and drag to the left or right in order to steer properly. Also some other minor issues as well.","Rock star games don't work on android 11! I have a 900.00 phone that can run any new mobile game at top settings.

Except this one. I just started, was learning all the controls and Bendy came. No big deal. Ill just hide. Well- the game lags just enough and Bendy just full out Sprints at you and with that combo, I get killed instantly. I cant play any farther because of that. If they fix that, then this will be defintally a 5 star review.","Devs, I know you're very busy with BATDR at the moment, but if there are any further updates for this game planned, could you please fix the crash issue? To my knowledge it doesn't happen on PC but on my Android device, in most cases, shortly after the safehouse loads (or even before), the game would crash. This fix would be greatly appreciated! Wishing you all the best on BATDR development.","Opened app to play game after a time without my phone and door is boarded shut and all other areas are just gone. All my progress is gone as well. Not a new phone. Didnt delete game. Its like an update happened and that update was to shut the game down. Ideas? Refund?","Again a really good game i recommend it for everyone. Boris and the dark survival is amost better than the first bendy game!! The only complaint I have is bendy kidu is hard to run away from. but still very VERY good game.","The game is great but there is only 2 problems 1. LAG 2. When you try to fix the games lag you have to turn the graphics way down and then the game looks disgusting."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.jds.batds","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jds.batds&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"DamonPS2 Pro 64bit - PS2 Emulator - PSP PPSSPP Emu","description":"The fastest PS2 emulator in global.

I especially bought this emulator for a long flight, and to my surprise I was unable to play during the whole flight because I wasn't able to connect to WiFi on board. If you don't have access constantly to internet or live in a remote area, I would avoid buying this emulator.","Poco X3 Pro is almost unplayable speed is too slow. 1x resolution will crush every single game. Too many graphical bugs. Broken sticks will make you impossible to aim. Not worth a single dollar. Updates are coming once per year... If we will lucky to get one more, but it won't improve anything. Developer ignores buyers and shares childporn in his own social media groups.","I have recently discovered this app is doing some very shady things. For starters, it should NOT have to have permissions for phone access. Second, after the recent update, I've been getting HAMMERED with spam messages, junk email, and random excessive phonecalls, from various automated places. This did not happen until I installed this app, and only got exponentially worse after the update. Also, I don't seem to be able to use without an internet/data connection. Again, WHY? Very shady.","Okay, I was very skeptical about this app. I had read different reviews and had watched videos and none of them were that flattering. However I decided to take the dive anyways and purchased it. And I have been pleasantly surprised. All the games I have tried thus far have worked, including, Gungrave, Magna Carta Tears of Blood, The Sword of Etheria, The Shining series of games, Ring of Red, Rogue Galaxy. Keep in mind the games I played were of the PAL region. Games played at full speed with little to no stutters and audio working nicely. The only downsides to this app is 1 the Price. It's steep. 2. The always online thing is annoying. It would be nice if we could play this without always being online so don't expect to play this if you are out camping with no reception. 3. You do need a beefy phone. I have a Black Shark 2 pro and it runs the games great. On my Razer Phone 2 games can run but they do chug a bit. So you need a high end phone from the last couple of years to really get the best out of this. So keep those things in mind before purchasing. Otherwise things for this are good.","****Edit after most recent update released**** I'm surprisingly impressed with how much of an improvement that update made with this app. I was previously unhappy that Star Ocean and Persona 4 were unplayable due to error / freezing. But now, aside from some minor rendering occurrences both play sufficiently using OnePlus 8T. Only complaint I have is Bluetooth controller is inoperable unless sync occurs after game launch, even when already synced. Fix it to receive 5 star, great improvement tho!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.damonplay.damonps2.pro.ppsspp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.damonplay.damonps2.pro.ppsspp&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"THE GAME OF LIFE Vacations","description":"Visit Volcano Island, make memories and have a great time!\r\n\r\nGo on a vacation, collect souvenirs and take pictures in this enjoyable board game for the whole family.

However it was also a welcome break from the diabolically clever and obscure Paradox! I have played all the Cube Escape series in order and am just starting on the paid games. They are all part of the storyline and I really enjoy trying to make some sense of it all. Especially since the POV character is Harvey ... Regardless I am happy to spend a few bucks to support the Rusty Lake team!","Babaal vai Babaal xD. I thoroughly enjoy the game. It's worth 5 star as per the story line and simple but tricky puzzle and the game flow. Also mentioning the graphics plus the voice over intro / outro is somehow unique and loved it. I felt like watching some mystery horror drama flims (the vibes ) ;) ________________ Keep making such stuffs dear team ♡♡","I really appreciated the cooking in this one, it added a nice bit of replayability to the game and overall just a great addition to the series!","Interesting brain puzzle game that makes you think! The art style and short narration is amazing! I look forward to more games by Rusty Lake!","Yet another amazing piece from the Rusty Lake story, I definitely got my money's worth, even if it is a bit shorter than expected.

If not, 1st. I love spaghetti so this game is my calling. I love all the different types of spaghetti choices and all the stuff you can unlock! I love all the upgrades and and outfits too! I love the style of all of the papa's games and this one is no exception. 10/10 definitely recommend","I've been playing this game on my iPad which I love, I like how the holidays are added where you can buy clothes for you're characters to wear, wish this was added in the other games, which makes everything more exciting when you play.","I played this game online on my laptop and the controls are soooo much easier there! Just click, drag, drop, that's it. I really expected this game to have similar controls but now I regret spending 2 euros on it. Wouldn't it make more sense if you could just drag the sauce and seasoning along the plate and tap where the toppings should be? I mean, this isn't a TOUCHscreen for nothing.","Currently I Bought every Single Game from Flipline Studios, 14 Total, so far. These are PERFECT, Fun & Challenging. Some People are complaining that this Game as well as the Others, that the Tutorial is too Difficult to Complete .. all I have to say is this, If you can't Complete these Tutorials, while a 8 Year Old easily can, You have no Business Playing these Types of Games. DO NOT, Give this or ANY other Flipline Game, a LOW Rating Because You can't get Past or Understand the Tutorial, it is not the Games Fault, it's Yours, Practice makes Perfect! Others have also Commented that at Times, these Games do not Work Correctly etc., again, these Games are made VERY well, DO NOT Blame Flipline, Check your Device for issues, Most likely the Problem lies within it. People, WE all PLAY these Types of Games, Just because, You can't Grasp the Premise of the Game or Find it, too Difficult, DON'T Place Blame on the Developer. These Types of Games, Require, at Times, Practice to Learn the Steps, in Order to get the Most FUN! Out of what is Presented, Giving up, Shouldn't Result in a BAD REVIEW for Flipline. Keep them Coming Flipline & I will Continue to BUY & Add to MY Collection & a GREAT Job to ALL Involved. Thanks :)","Love this game! You cook the pasta, stir it, sauce it, and put some bread in the oven! Very simple games! Very addicting! I love how they reused the build station from Pancakeria To Go and it feels so great!

Just being able to put covers, amount of enemies, any modes (bomb/hostage/just killhouse) in any map would be much appreciated. Ps, pls increase the zoom","I love this game, however I wish their was a gas unit, ex: a man throws a smoke grenade through the door or out the window, and using tear gas to help disorient large groups of enemies, etc... plus you should add new maps and levels! If you do add the Gas unit, you should add new equipment like night vision or thermal vision. And make night missions a little more realistic.

In depth squad customization & tons of replayability; there is an option for randomy generated levels and tons of challenges to complete throughout standalone levels & campaigns.

Policy and religion building is excellent, research and crafting systems are top notch. And on top of all of that, the price tag is surprisingly low for a game with absolutely no ads or microtransactions. This will be the game I measure all other games of the type by.","It's not really that AFK, at least at the start. Your storage is filed within 10-30 minutes, so the best and fastest way to play is come back every 20 minutes. Later on you get upgrades that a small change, or small procent gets converter from raw recourse to refined. No help in game but there is a link to a wiki where you need to read about everything. Efter the run reset I played a lot, as said about every 20 minutes, and it was fast. Now more AFK and it's stupid slow. Over 1500 years .","Kittens game is the gold standard for idle progressive games. I've done a handful of others within the genre, but I always come back to the kittens. The developer does an amazing job with Wube level support on the game, and is quick to offer support. While there are a few weird wrapping issues, it's mostly due to phone resolution and such, and not really anything I'd expect an easy solution for. There's a reason this game has been around as long as it has. Get it.","Ive been having a great time up until the other day where my 5 month old save was wiped. I just opened the game and it was all reset, including my graphical settings. After a day or 2 of being reasonably upset I jumped back in, and today i lost about 2 hours of progress because the game had something similar to a Minecraft server rollback. I love this game dearly but these new save wiping issues are going to rapidly deteriorate my enjoyment.","Probably the best idle game I've ever played. Not like most of the Isle games on here.

But, i won't say the android port is a good port. I have this remastered one, on my switch and i would said it's good because it use controller. But, on android? Meh, it feels like played on the emulator. They cramped the virtual button on the screen, so, it's feel awful to look at. Moreover, the button, especially the \"B\" button is not too responsive, so it it really give a hard time, when you need to cancel choice.","Great game that I grew up with. It really takes me back. However I am very disappointed that the pc version has more content especially in regards to the cheat menu. I've been playing this game for over fifteen years and have beaten it many times sometimes its nice to have some cheats in to increase replay value. At least in my opinion.","Unplayable! Same issue as last review. Assets aren't clearing at scene changes. So every new scene, you get the last scenes background on top of everything else. Same with the cursor in the load screen as well, when you move it, it stays and a new one pops up until all options have a cursor, and you can't tell what you have selected. Really disappointed after spending $20 on what should have been a sure thing.","It worked fine on my last phone, but ever since I upgraded, the game has been buggy. I started over, and it keeps an image of the bed from the infirmary on the screen, blocking your character. You can't see anything or move around really. This is my favorite game of all time, and I really want to play it, but these issues are making it impossible. Even at the start screen, the finger doesn't move. So, you don't know if you're loading a game, starting a new one, or loading the credits.","I think I'm just amazed that just over twenty years later we get to play this classic on a phone, and it's updated. I was hesitant to buy it at first because of reviews covering issues about glitches and lagging. You just need to have a legitimate gaming phone I guess. I'm using a Blu g90 pro and it seems to run flawlessly. I love this game and now I get to take it everywhere I go <3.

After weeks of waiting on becalmed seas, our swashbuckling team of developers have released a patch filled with features and fixes.","comments":["This game is PRICELESS! For all new and old D&D fans, this game is just about everything you could ask for. I grew up on this series playing it on Windows 98. The game does not feel like a fairytale-land story, has dark aspects to it, and is enjoyable for countless hours. If you are debating if it is worth the price, I can assure you IT IS. I know the graphics aren't spectacular, but if you would open up your mind, you will find the story is EXTREMELY enjoyable one that expands over 3 games. 😎","Can we get an update for this? Every time I boot it says it was made for an older version of Android and may not work properly. Also the screen needs to be stretched to fit the native resolution. You can barely ready anything. Good game other than that, OG 90's one of the better PC games of the era.","Strange navigation finally broke the game for me. For example, there's no direct way to go west from Beregost temple to Beregost. Instead, you've got to exit off the north edge of the map before the desire to change areas is even recognized. That's not such a big deal --after all, the game is still playable. But then I discovered that I cannot get to Safana's area at all--not from any direction. I've got a newer Lenovo chromebook.","The game runs PERFECT. You can zoom in if the game is a little small. It does take some getting used to, but still–rerolling stats for 3 hours never felt so good. Just like the old days.","I have purchased this. However, after downloading and running I get the message 'download failed because you may not have purchased the app'. This is after downloading from the play store itself. Edit: The link in the reply seems to be a 'me too' style thread with no real fix for the problem. I tried all suggested fixes. Edit2: Tried to buy Baldurs gate II EE and get the same licencing issue.

Your goal is to get through all of the tournaments to be the Teeny Champion! My one change I'd want is there to be PVP (Player Vs. Player), but other than that, totally recommend","Absolutely love it! Can you please fix the resolution for devices such as the Samsung Galaxy S20 where the sides are cut off? I'd rather have black space above and below instead of being unable to read text in speech bubbles.","It's fun, a great time killer, the price is great for this game, but the optimization for newer phones is awful.","This game is REALLY good besides brother blood. His robot attack is so op because u can spawn like 5 of them. It's a four for now until u make the robots like the hive robot, how u can spawn only two of them. Also I first found this in the Atlantic tourney. Thanks! :D Keep up the good work! I also have another bug. It's in the Justice League Tryouts thing. When you get the dance mode and get the erase effects tofu, it erases the disco.","Can you update some of the things in it are distorded like some bars are huge and some coins go off screen and some the characters are stretched but the gameplay overall is good some of the things that i mentioned are bugging me when i play the game so please update it if you can :'("],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.turner.ttgfigures","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.turner.ttgfigures&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"SpongeBob: Sponge on the Run","description":"Race through all new worlds in SpongeBob: Sponge on the Run!\r\n\r\nSpongeBob and Plankton are in a race to find the lost Krabby Patty formula somewhere in Bikini Bottom, Apocalyptic Bikini Bottom and a real-world beach.

This really is the entirety game I played on PC, but on my phone. And I thought I was a graphics and performance elitist, but I really can't see a difference. In fact, I prefer the tilt controls here over the weird way the pc version interprets the analog stick. My one complaint is that it makes my S21 run hot with the case on, but that's probably more about the phone than the game. And cases.","Absolutely wonderful , but is there a way to make a control optimization for phone with sensor , as my gaming phone has a sensor it would be great advantage for me to play more comfortably maybe a button for gear change , brake , etc. so that my sensor can trigger it ? Anyway , just wanted to say people who worked on this hame really is amazing , this is what I call a mobile game !","I absolutely like this game PROS: -Excellent engine sounds for all cars -Detailed audio inside the cockpit -Wonderful tracks and graphics -No Pay-To-Win B.S -No other racing game here compares to this -Free DLC! CONS: -Challenging, sometimes frustrating and time consuming -Can't modify control layouts -A.I likes to crash often -Cockpit gauges non-functional -Crashes sometimes on my LG V60, Android 11","1) Graphic is not as good as it has been credited, rr3 is way better and details. Just look at camera view from inside the cockpit, there is no details at all. Also the engine sound is not so distinct between car. 2) control and handling are more like a rally car technics than race track/tarmac that can perform high speed cornering as it should be and again rr3 is better. Other than 2 factors mentioned, this game have more options for configuration, diffeculties,race mode,cars and tracks","Game graphics are very amazing but controls of game could be more better like we in tilt device control we have to completely turn our phone from one side to other.

Fortunately the difficulty ramps up slowly enough to allow for a decent amount of enjoyable play before the too-difficult-to-be-fun phase is reached. Some sort of hint feature would be helpful as would be some sort of instructions or tutorial for newcomers, but unfortunately there are none of these.","This is one of the best puzzle games on Android. While I find the game to be fairly easy overall, every level is cleverly designed. In lieu of a tutorial, the game itself shows you every new mechanic, which combined with the handy undo button makes progress painless. Beautiful graphics, pleasing sound effects, and an excellent ambient soundtrack top off the experience, making for a great little game at a good price with no ads or microtransactions.","Great game, I love the thought that is required; But I got stuck on 5-4, and there are no skips or hints, so I can no longer play. Edit: Got it lol","Unique gameplay, nice art style, well executed. My only complaint is that the solutions aren't always elegant. When the solution requires hitting it in the water on purpose to set up for the next shot or hitting backwards off a wall to eat up a stroke it feels kind of hacky.","This game totally gives me \"Zany golf\" vibes.

And like others have said, it is quite addictive! But at least it makes you think while you're doing it. The only complaint I have is that the UI scales up to 150% but being on a Pixel 4a buttons are still small and the text needs options to be larger also. Otherwise thank you.","This game is hard. By hard I mean, it makes you think critically and remember what actions may provide what results. It took me hours and a spoiler free synopsis video before I understood what I was playing. Once I took the time to learn the idea of this game and really appreciate what was in front of me, my enjoyment skyrocketed.","Absolutely fantastic game, never have cards and timers been stuffed with such compelling narrative. However, my DLC purchases keep not carrying over whenever I have to replace my devices. I recently replaced my phone and all my DLC except the exile managed to carry over for a change and I really don't want to buy DLC for a third time.","Great game, but I wish this Android version were more full-featured. I'm playing this on a Chromebook, but this version of the game was clearly designed with only mobile in mind. Why is there no ability to zoom in and out with a mouse wheel? It would make playing this game a much smoother experience.","Amazing. I have lost so many hours to this game. It is difficult at first! I lost four or five games within the first 20 minutes. But once you get the hang of things it gets easier to get by, and then the challenge is moving forward. I finally won my first ever game and it was three exceedingly intense days.

THIS is what idle games WISH they were. To be clear, it's NOT am idle game. However the game is set up so that you make all the decisions for your character and his skills, then sit back and watch the payoff when he fights. It's like a strategic fight club coaching sim. I've played through it once and I wound up reinstalling it and I'm going through again. Plus I love the classic 8-bit look. Well done, devs.","Decent game, not long enough to warrant purchase. I thoroughly enjoyed my AGILITY run and the pros and cons with it, but after the \"beginning phase\" of the game you stop getting thrashed around and it's almost a fast track to the end of the game. At first there are many paths a person can take in both stats, perks and story, but it all ultimately ends too soon. Once I got a few abilities that I deemed as a must have, all fights started becoming easier and without strategery. Then the game ends.","Pretty fun, no microtransactions, overall just a solid game. A few things of note would be there's a few paths to go down, and you fight a buncha interesting characters. Keeping up with training is hard but rewarding.

They're used to playing it on a laptop at home. This makes it more convenient to be played anywhere we go. My oldest has eye teaming issues that make traditional learning to read programs difficult, my middle child has sensory issues that make traditional learning settings stressful, and my youngest can't sit still at all LOL. This game and app have made learning to read easier and enjoyable for all my children. They have a blast with it!","My little man loves this game. It's really well designed and is really helping with his letters and words. Halfway through he got a letter from his monster saying how well he was doing which was fab, and that led him to want to complete the first steps ASAP 😆 The only gripe I could mention, which he finds frustrating, is when you get an award in game and the fruit scatters all over, more often than not, his monster gets sucked up into a game before he can collect his fruit. Otherwise, fabulous!","My son is 4 at the time of this review. He's been playing this game since he was about 2.5 almost 3 years old and we love it. Obviously at first he really didn't understand how to play and just loved all the sounds and creating his monster. However, over time it really helped him learn his letters and letter sounds. We took a technology break but he still asks to play Monsters. This has become one of our homeschooling essentials. I regularly recommend this app to everyone. The hardest part has been getting him to stop playing. 😆","We love it. It's a great sidekick to the Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons book (which we've used for three kids so far). However, whatever accent the narrator has makes it really tough for my 4yo to understand what sound they are asking for. It would be *immensely* improved by the option of American English.","Amazing phonics app. My eldest was in Reception when the first lockdown happened and this app helped her to practise and learn new phonics knowledge that complimented her school work. She got frustrated when the game advanced and she wasn't familiar with the next sounds so I found it great to use alongside phonics lessons - it isn't an all in one phonics teacher. Now she's yr 1 and finished the game. She loved it and the games. Her 4 year old sister just finished the 1st world.

Opens for one second, if that, and closes immediately. I've tried resetting my phone, I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Nothing... Edit: WHY THE HELL ISNT THIS FIXED YET?????????? Edit #2: the fact that this has still not been fixed after months of negative reviews and emails for support is absolutely disgraceful. Shame on you Rockstar, you've officially lost a lifelong customer. I hope to hell I'm not the only one. Pathetic.","Since the last Android update, the app has stopped working completely; it even refuses to open. And to be honest, I'm not expecting a patch or something like that anytime soon (since Rockstar doesn't really care about it's older IPs anymore). So yeah, there it goes, I payed for a game that I cannot longer enjoy.","This game was amazing, a very pleasant surprise. Some missions are a little frustrating but for the most part it's a lot of fun. Vehicle physics are good, weapons feel nice too. The story is a little underwhelming, but overall it's pretty cool. The graphics are the best available for mobile GTA games too, just surpassing GTA SA because of SA's terrible looking nature sections. Overall I do recommend this game and I think it's worth your time.","The game worked on my last phone, but not on my new phone. It just crashes after looking at a guy on a motorcycle. Dang, I just wanted to play some liberty city stories. It crashes on a Samsung Galaxy s20fe 5g. Please fix this when you have the time. Thank you for helping me get nostalgic for GTA again.","This game is a masterpiece. The mobile port is the definitive way to play this game. If you're collecting every GTA game like me, this isn't a bad way to play. This is the only version supporting 1080p. The PlayStation 2 version has a higher draw distance, but only supports 480i. The PSP is at an even lower 240p. With a Bluetooth controller, this is pretty much the best official way to play the game. It's definitely better than the PSP version, and debatably better than the PS2 version."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.rockstargames.gtalcs","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rockstargames.gtalcs&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Attack the Light","description":"Team up as Garnet, Pearl, Amethyst, and Steven to stop a powerful Gem weapon in Attack the Light!\r\n \r\nCRYSTAL GEM POWER\r\nFire off Garnet’s Rocket Gauntlets, summon Holo-Pearl, and put the hurt on your enemies with Purple Puma.

Here&#39;s what&#39;s new:<br>- Fix for black screen bug<br>- Other performance improvements","comments":["This game...is AMAZING!!!! 😆 I love garnet, amethyst and pearl, the controls are perfect, animation is perfect, and not any bugs! It was a little hard at first, but I have finished the game and it's super easy now. It is fun to play and can pass the time, and it's so much like the show. It is soon worth it. 👍👍👍","(The black screen bug is back plz fix) Love this game for alot of reasons 1. Its a good story for a RPG 2. Its fun and easy to play 3. The fact that you got the people who play the caritors that they play in the show is a rare thing 4. The fact that when you are given a choice you can eather be super serious or just plain stupid funny is amazing... Who dosen't want Pizzia after what they been through.","It's good, but there's a few things I'd recommend patching. Firstly, the giant moths aren't processed as giant enemies by the game. Secondly, I've noticed Garnet's shield breaker attack can bypass the bubbles of the anglers if you're lucky enough to do damage from it. Thirdly, fire salt only takes effect when you attack, but not block. Fourthly, after u defeat the fourth boss, if there's still fish-esq creatures on the ground, they just sit there, not sure if it's intentional, but whatever 😐👍?","Visually appealing but mechanically frustrating. The window of opportunity to defend attacks is super small. You have to anticipate exactly when enemies will hit. If you're off by half a second, you take full damage. And that is different from the timing of accomplishing double attacks. It takes a lot of concentration to strategize AND keep track of opportunity windows. Otherwise this is a very appealing game.","Ok I really love this game my favorite show when I was younger was Steven universe and then I found this game and it's so much fun but it would be cooler if you could have like bismuth lapis lazuli and more of the crystal gems but I really love this game"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.turner.stevenrpg","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.turner.stevenrpg&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Toca Blocks","description":"Toca Blocks is a unique world-building app that lets you create worlds, play in them and share them with friends. Where will your imagination take you?\r\n\r\nBUILD\r\nConstruct worlds and fill them with your own adventurous paths.

Worth the $30. I dont like the silly and unchangeable name I've been allocated, and the grids could be a lot bigger - I often hit the wrong square on my device - but overall it's a safe purchase.","I love this game when it works. But too often one of three things happens - 1 - I get an \"Opponent Left the Game\" error message before the game even starts. This happens at least five times before I can connect to an opponent. 2 - There are way too many bot opponents in the Play Online game. 3 - The network connection fails in the middle of the game way too often. This is not a problem on my end as I have no similar issues with any other app. I would give 5 stars if these issues were fixed.","Purchased to play with my daughter, but cannot. As others have said, there's a constant connectivity loss. Facebook log in is blank on both devices. Three stars because the GUI and idea is great.","Fun but would be better if there was an opportunity to chat in the online games. I'd like to message this supposed online 'real' player that it's BS that happen to know where to shoot all the time! Update, internet connection issues all the time.

Rate Sonic Runners Adventure now, and let everyone know your true-blue opinion!","comments":["Feels like a quick cash grab with a third of the content compared to the original. If you ever played the original sonic runners which I have and love it this game borrows some similarities to the original like the music boss fights and try's to copy it's gameplay and also adding \"forced sections\" where basically the game plays it's self and a bonus stage. The difficulty ramps up quick and feels unfair and there aren't enough characters or abilities to help much don't waste your money 😥 💸 RIP","This is an excellent, very challenging but also very fun, sonic game, with lots of levels and characters to unlock. My only criticism (and the reason I took a star off) is it says you only need an Internet connection for first game launch, but it does a license verification periodically, so you have to have some sort of internet randomly (which isn't always convenient).","It's a good game, and I appreciate that it's standalone and lacks microtransactions. The UI still feels as busy as the average gacha game despite that, though. The big kicker for me though is that it completely lacks cloud save support, which for a game with major progression is no good.","It's cool but you need fast reflexes to keep up or you'll lose rings. You need to dodge enemies, bombs, holes, and maybe if you playing in that goal mode you can't take damage. It's kinda hard.","This is the worst Sonic game I've ever played. At least in Sonic 06 you have active control over the character. This game doesn't even let you choose whether or not to run. I've requested a refund several times and not once did I get 1 cent. I just want my God damn money back"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftICHM","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftICHM&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Papa's Taco Mia To Go!","description":"It's a flavor fiesta in this new version of Papa's Taco Mia, with gameplay and controls reimagined for phones and smaller screens!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between four areas of the taco shop, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.

Which is really awesome! Has a few classes to choose from in the beginning of the game. All have unique and very different abilities and play styles. A bunch of armor/weapon upgrades. Grinding is pretty satisfying if you go that route and replay missions for loot.","It's fun for the PvE but the game is a complete cashgrab, everyone pays to win for the online,making it impossible to play.For the campaign, it's all just a loop! And there's no actual story.I understand for the campaign it gets harder and harder,until a point where you need to pay to actually beat a level! Complete cashgrab,if you think I'm kidding,go try it yourself.","The PVE in this game is wonderful and real fun trying to grind endlessly for some gems. The gems system isn't horrible unlike other games which is even more grindy, but the problem is the PVP. I'm getting matched with people 2x my own attack power and I'm at 30,000. The matchmaking is not that well balanced and plenty of pay-to-wins there. Maybe make less overpowered deals or something. Other than that it's a pretty good game.","Total PTD (Pay to Dominate) however iys possible to get far in the game by grinding and getting item drops, watching adds for reward X upto 10. I thank the Dev for opening all characters for free and the generous allotment of video supported enhancements. Easily get a powerful character fast if you don't mind watching a lot of 30s game ads. If you want to pay for packs pets etc, plenty of options under $5 with great gear. Update after a more hrs of play, trying other characters but no pay.","Grounded enemies can't hit you while you are jumping so you can pretty easily 3 star areas just by spamming jump attack. Doesn't work for flying or projectile enemies but it's very boring to be near invincible in a hack n slash. It also uses the worst free-to-play model by requiring energy to play levels which you either buy or wait to refill (no option to pay for unlimited energy either). Not for me but the graphics are nice, the controls feel solid."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.Zonmob.Stickman.FightingGames.ShadowOfDeath","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Zonmob.Stickman.FightingGames.ShadowOfDeath&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Crying Suns","description":"When FTL meets Foundation and Dune: Crying Suns is a tactical rogue-lite that puts you in the role of a space fleet commander as you explore a mysteriously fallen empire.

Someone had said there want much story to this game but I would disagree. Like a great book, I couldn't put it down. It does sometimes get redundant with random side scenarios but other than that it was a lot of fun. I played on easy all the way through which probably took about 8 hrs.","Got it out of boredom, expecting a fun time-killer. Instead, I got something that was a proper game, with great writing and atmosphere. Gameplay can get a little bit repetitive at times, but the story, while cheesy at first, definitely carries it to the end. Controls are a tad clunky, but that's to be expected with a complex mobile game. Definitely a little frustrating on a small phone screen though. But that was just a minor annoyance, I didn't encounter anything gamebreaking.","The game begins great. The main plot is interesting at first and makes you want to learn what happened and why the universe is the way it is. However, after the first two chapters you've already seen everything the game has to offer gameplay-wise, so the only thing to look forward to is the unravelling of the mystery. Furthermore, there is a lot of repetition in the events you encounter along the way. There are too many \"advertising beacon\" encounters that only come with a little bit of text and nothing else. You will frequently see the same events play out in different sectors, so after a while you will know in advance how things are going to play out. There is too much RNG involved in whether or not you will be able to upgrade your battleship and the fighters you deploy, while the farther you get in a sector, the better equipped the enemies are. In chapter 3 the difficulty becomes really unbalanced and with the clunky controls combat turns into a chore.","Honest review. I play a lot of video games and this has been on my \"list\" to play for a while. I finally picked it up and it does not make anysense at all. It just throws you in a bunch of menus and that would be cool if it made sense. I looked at it for more then 10 minutes I was just like \"yeah I have no idea what's going on\"","Just spent 3h finishing first chapter. This game has been sitting in my library for a while. Picked it up in lockdown and felt so intrigued by it. The RTS was good and has some depth. The story is well written and integrated into the game. I don't normally do reviews but felt this game is a piece of art and deserve some recognition. If you like RTS, don't get put off by the graphic for the first 10m and you will not regret."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.altshift.cryingsuns","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.altshift.cryingsuns&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Sonic 4™ Episode I","description":"Featuring enhanced gameplay elements, including the classic Sonic Spin Dash, and the versatile Homing Attack, Sonic 4 picks up right where Sonic and Knuckles™ left off.\r\n__________________________________________________\r\n2 EXCLUSIVE LEVELS!!!  \r\nTwo exclusive levels built specifically for smartphones using the accelerometer. \r\n\r\nNEW MOVES  \r\nAll of Sonic's classic moves are available, including the newer Homing Attack which will add a new level of control and excitement.\r\n\r\nCLASSIC SONIC STAGES   \r\nRace through 4 unique zones containing 4 acts each as well as 7 special stages. \r\n\r\nSPECIAL STAGES RETURN  \r\nA staple of the Genesis-era games, the special stages return allowing fans to collect the 7 Chaos Emeralds and unlock Super Sonic. \r\n\r\nREVAMPED CLASSIC BOSS BATTLES  \r\nDr. Eggman returns with new and improved mechas and will go berserk when he accumulates damage.\r\n\r\n¬¬\r\nGamePro - “…this looks and feels like a genuine Sonic game, deserving of the \"4\" attached to its title.”\r\nIGN – “After an afternoon in its presence it's become seared in our conscience just like the classic levels of the early Sonics – and surely that's reason enough to have faith in Sonic the Hedgehog 4.”\r\n\r\nBe the first to know!

The controls are small and can't be changed, but they are not difficult and it's still easy to control Sonic's direction. The boss fights take ideas from older ones and put a little spin to them. The cam may always stick low in some boss fights, but this is a great high speed game with some unique features. Just keep a open mind when playing it, don't immediately go into hate. You'll love it, trust me.","Kinda worse than the original, but not too bad. Negative things? Plenty. Loading screens on stages, that are longer than SONIC '06, buttons are so small it's sometimes hard to control Sonic, physics are still not that great, and the sound effects are pitched down. There is something positive. The sprites are now not extremely shiny. That's something good at least. It's not the best, but at least we got another Sonic game for mobile.","This game is really great and I like it, the graphics are colorful, the music is wonderful. The game is also really fun. And so is episode 2. I really like this game, a lot is a great platform, are I recommend you play it Controls are really great and overall is a really great game.","Kinda disappointing because the game has such a tiny amount of stages and there are also loads of bugs and ads and as well the game matches more of a modern universe game than a classic one","Sega, i need you to fix the game. Well to that: The buttons are to small, the loading is so slow, why tilt to get the chaos emeralds, and when sonic is in his super form, the theme is just the invinciblity theme instead of the super theme + his super animation looks like he's scared and glitched. And the game does not save data, it erases the data on the game and i have to start all over! Please fix so i can enjoy the game better than the PS3, xbox and wii.

However, I have a little issue (so only four stars) that there's not modability for units. I used to play with zero turns recruit and general unit on certain cavalry units. Now I have to rely on cheat commands to recruit (at least on Android it works, on the pc that particular cheat didn't) and only family members for governors, which is a bit inconvenient, leaving me with cities without a governor.","It is an incredible achievement to get this game on an android. Looks gorgeous and has everything from the original. The campaign screen is easy to control and is very well laid out. However after a few hours I requested a refund. The battles are impossible to control without a mouse and larger screen. Trying to move units and arrange them left me tearing my hair out in frustration. I really admire what they've done (hence the 5 stars) and if you auto resolve battles you'll love this game","Important note: Works on nokia 5.3. You just need to wait like 5 minutes after running the game for it to move past the black screen and wait out the intro videos. No problems or slowdowns in the actual game Good port of a great game. Some control design needs more work (like setting formations) but overall a good experience. You are going to be using the pause button a lot more than in the pc due to the controls but its no biggie.","I'd give more stars, as it's a great game, however, I think it is pretty ridiculous that this game only partially works on an s21+, where it worked flawlessly on my old s8+. Seems to me, as a major developer, the game should be updated, but I guess this is what you can expect from software companies these days....","Pros: Pretty much the original game. Some changes were inevitable to account for smaller screens, but overall a very good port. Some of the UI changes look better than the original game imo. Cons: The battle controls are sometimes just non functional, especially for siege battles. Slightly repositioning a unit or tightly placing multiple units next to each other simply doesn't work and the units get selected/deselected instead. The game randomly crashes, similar to the original RTW."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.feralinteractive.rometw","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.feralinteractive.rometw&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Toca Lab: Plants","description":"Just like with the first app in the Toca Lab Series, Toca Lab: Elements, your curiosity will lead the way.

Reinstalling makes it work, but then when starting up the game a 2nd time after the fresh install, it starts crashing all over again. I really like this game, but I'm not sure if I like it enough to have to reinstall it every time I want to play it.","After I updated the game, it keeps crashing. I restarted my phone but it still keeps on crashing. My last hope is clearing its data, so guess what? Its still keeps crashing and my data has been erased even though it is connected to my google play account. Another data to waste to redownload this game. I'll edit my review later if I solved it or not. Edit: Its working again, but I lost my progress even though I cloud saved it. ):> Edit2: yep, its still crashing, pls. Optimize it :<","Still my favorite rhythm game but since the last 4 big updates, the games stutter and makes me lose my combo, can't even play the intro without lagging. With the last 2 updates, now it takes like a minute to load every menu, character, song and the black market. I can't play anymore. My phone is not the best but even like that the game used to run smoothly without any of the above mentioned. Hope it gets fixed. Till then, no more cytus 2.","Phenomenal game. I remember waiting anxiously for it to release in my high-school homeroom, and I've been playing it since the day it came out. Beautiful artwork, story, and music. The game is completely realized and provides more than enough content to fully enjoy the game without having to make a single additional purchase; however, if you do choose to buy an expansion it's more than worth the money. Rayark knocked it out of the park with this one, a 10/10 experience.","Missing game content that I have purchased before I had bought a bunch of the characters a while back and they are all locked behind a pay wall again I had problems spent 50-60$ on them and I can't play them if there is a way to get them back I would love to play em again I think the new 4.1 update also deleted all my progress as well I am very upset that this is even an issue"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.rayark.cytus2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rayark.cytus2&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"PAW Patrol: Air & Sea","description":"Pups Take Flight is now PAW Patrol Air and Sea Adventures!

I read the reviews before purchasing so I knew that it only gave you half the game but my son wouldn't stop bothering me about it so we bought it anyway. It's not a bad game, just not worth 3.99. Should be 1.99 or the full game for 2.99. Not much to the game it's pretty simple my two year old can play it, but an older kid would get bored.","I do like this Game but there is one minor pain in the new MGM logo how long it takes to load.","Another purchase that is falsely advertising what you get. Air and sea... but you have to buy the sea pack after you purchase the app. Further more the animation is horible and nowhere near the quality of the tv show, the gameplay is weak and the tracing of geometric shapes baiscly draws themselves. Not worth the purchase or the additional drama of more payments.","Very misleading.

Please work on this!","Buggy version of a beloved classic game. Crashes upon loading Charwood without fail. Crashes upon loading Coldwood without fail, which then makes progress impossible. I would use console commands to bypass this issue, but can't find the map names using Android. Tried to the same result on multiple characters with different builds. No progress is possible with Coldwood bugged. Please, please fast track a fix. I'm not the only one having the same issues, it's in the forums as well.","Sent in a support request over 3 weeks ago. Other than their original confirmation response, I've heard nothing and they have not replied to my e-mails either. I understand they are experiencing a 'higher than normal request volume', but it's ridiculous that someone who can't play the game has been ignored for this length of time.","This game doesn't have controller support, and I couldn't afford a keyboard for my tablet at the time of getting this version (used to have it on pc ages ago from an actual cd), and found the touch screen to be horrendous for controlling the game imho. So it's been a long time of being unable to play. But I was given a bluetooth keyboard and now I guess I can finally play. still would be awesome to see some sort of controller support in the future if you're interested in trying, beamdog!","Honestly, I don't expect perfection from games anymore. Just as long as I enjoy it. I would have given 5 stars, but when I'm playing Wizard, the game freezes up completely every time I try and learn a spell from a scroll. This ruins the class for me, which is my favorite unfortunately. Edit again. 5 out of 5. Wizard class works perfectly now. I'm so stoked, thank you so much.

Only issue i have with it is the calibration. It constantly goes from around 250 to 300 ms at seemingly random. It also seems to break most of the time when checkpoints are used, bringing the song offbeat and offtiming things, making worlds like XO and XT more difficult than needed.","This game is one of the best rhythm games I have ever played. The music is catchy and the level graphics are amazing and still well optimized. The concept is an amazing idea and was executed excellently. The balancing on the levels is decent, and the levels are lots of fun to play and unique in their own way. This is a rhythm game for beginners, but not a beginner's rhythm game. Looking forward to the addition of the level editor on the mobile version!","Like the warning said, this game is very reliant on rhythm and keeping the beat. That being said, it's a game that have a simple control or gameplay, but really hard to master, at least for me. It is my first time buying a game. Definitely, worth my money. I'm going to stay with this game so my sense of rhythm can be corrected. Hehe.","Phew! I first thought it was simple when I saw it on social media where influencer plays it, it looks real simple! But after I downloaded it, and experienced, it was extremely interesting and unexpectedly hard. For me, it really is an interesting game and helps you to get the beat well. I highly recommend playing this game!","Love the idea of this game but doesn't seem to work on mobile.

Can honestly say I have no regrets buying this. Excellent console like graphics, the controls are well thought out, yet it plays just like a top notch mobile phone game should. Like Dirt 5 in your pocket. Kudos to the developers for making this. Well done!","The game has excellent graphics, straightforward racing events with no dialogues and other useless sidekicks, and what matters the most - no ads and no pay-to-win tactics!! I also want to mention great customer support. Developer is always there to answer your queries or refund money if you're not happy with the game (he refunded to me).

Well done for how much content you have managed to squeeze in such a small size. This one will be always one of my favourites. I am missing rallycross season/championship in the game, you may want to look into that. Thanks","This game is really great! I reccomend this to anyone who loves rally and/or racing, because the graphics are AMAZING, the gameplay is absolutely WONDERFUL, and the physics are just- WoWo. I already love it although I've just started playing on my touchscreen Chromebook, and the areas you race in are actually real roads. So many modes, so much opportunity, I even see it as a DiRT contender. The price is so worth it. Thank you Brownmonster for creating this masterpiece of a game!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"brownmonster.app.game.rushrally3","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=brownmonster.app.game.rushrally3&hl=en&gl=us"}]
