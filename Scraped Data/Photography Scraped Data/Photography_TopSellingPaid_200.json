Update June, 2021: The app was not working and after reaching out to the developer he was persistent in doing what he could to help me troubleshoot the problem. In the end we discovered that it was a lack of available storage on my phone cause the problem & after cleaning up the old pics & files on the phone, all was working as it should again.","LOOOVING this app! Being able to SOO EASILY remove objects is FANTASTIC!!! Aannddd :) NEVER has a vexacious AD popped up, NOR a forced monitary wringer to \"upgrade\" in order to \"access better\" attributes!! It is user friendly, and overall a MAGNIFICENT APP!!!!! You won't be dissapointed! :) Light & Love to ALL!","dear developer, my only complaint for this app is the lack of confirmation popup for the \"modify original photo\" option when saving. I accidentally pressed it now my original photo is gone. I hope you guys acknowledge this review thank you. (*update* 24/5/2021 : after months the devs finally added the feature. better late than never. good job !)","My honest review: still hit-and-miss here and there, especially if the photograph is overly complicated, but this one does way better job than Snapseed or PS Express! MYR7.99 well spent. Recommended! Thanks devs! Keep it up!","It is the best tool to mass edit 360 photos for Google street View and I already retouched 1000+ panoramas with it. You just open the app on your huge 4K display from Chromebox and erase yourself from panorama with lasso, stamp and line remover tools. However there is one most desired tool missed from this app. It should be a specific tool to erase not the photografer him self but his shadow by adding light on a backgroud boudared with lasso perimiter. Lasso tool works good only for regular backgroud but failed for stairs (especially for very thin stairs and escalators). It will be nice to see improvement in this part for lasso tool."],"editorsChoice":true,"appId":"com.advasoft.touchretouch","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.advasoft.touchretouch&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Simple Gallery Pro: Video & Photo Manager & Editor","description":"Simple Gallery Pro brings you all the photo viewing and editing features you have been missing on your Android in one stylish easy-to-use app. Browse, manage, crop and edit photos or videos faster than ever, recover accidentally deleted files or create hidden galleries for your most precious images and videos.

It should be a simple process, but it has been a real headache. First of all, why make us type in the number of pixels? Why can't we just enter a percent (i.e. if you want to make the photo 50% smaller or 200% bigger)? I had to resize one photo over and over because it would not save (despite the app saying it did). Now I'm soured on this glitchy app. PLEASE FIX THIS GLITCH! Then I may give you a better rating.","My current phone only has Google Photos as the default app, and I hate it. I love Simple Gallery so much. My photos are so well organized now, and getting them that way as so fast and hassle free. I also love that it has a recycling bin folder that is created whenever you delete pictures (after you empty it, the folder goes away until you delete something else). I was able to rescue a photo that I selected in a large batch of deletions on accident.","Have been using the free version of this app for a few weeks on my new Motorola 5G phone. Worked pretty well once I figured it out. But since the last update it has gotten rid of many of the features I was using. Tried updating to Pro but still not doing what it use to. Now can't edit most of my photos or simply rename them. If not fixed will be looking for another app","I did leave a 3 star review yesterday but now I can't find it. I'm updating to 5 star as the issue I had I've now resolved. When I tried to share edited photos, it would only show the unedited originals (even though I deleted those after editing). However I've since found when you actually attach them, it then updates and shows the edited photo. All in all this app is great, very similar to the old Album app which a lot of Sony users will have been used to but the editing on this is far superior","Great app. Been using it quite awhile now and an very happy. I do wish there was a feature to make downsized copies of selected images before sending so that I can compress more images into an outgoing email.

It is super helpful for knowing where the sun is going to be at any given place or time. Wish I would have gotten this app sooner. I recomend checking out Outdoor Photography's series on YouTube that explains how to use different parts of the app. I wouldn't try to learn the app on your own as it can have a steep learning curve.","Doesn't provide enough to justify 10$ when other apps do more for free. Reply to dev: yes absolutely. Your vr is actually the least feature rich out of any vr out there. Maybe you should understand that with high cost for charging for an app you should provide more for it. For instance, why do you not show Polaris in your VR? Why do you not offer labels for your planner on what the different colors mean in the top bar? There is plenty of space to show the time, degree, then label. Why not include a light pollution map? Instead of arguing with your customers, work with them to better your \"premium\" app.","Best app for photographers! Simply as that! At the first time can be a bit overwhelming the app because there are so much function to use but the creators has a lots of video on YouTube about it. This app is a must for every photographers!","Just installed and tried some plans. It seems that everything works fine. Very impressed with the quantity of functions, the way they fit everything in the interface for usablility. The tutorials are well done and the use becomes more intuitive with the time. Great work, the app brings some fun too. AR is great.","I use the app for several functions.

Also whenever I would adjust my ISO or shutter speed the iso would reset to auto a little aggravating when I'm attempting to take night photographs and I need as much light through the camera","One of the best camera apps I think. Premium version absolutely worth it. You cannot crop the pics tho and have an issue where it'll cut out the majority of the picture it'll try to take due to the size it's set to. But no matter what I switch it to, it still won't capture the whole photo.. so that's why I had to leave off the last star.","Best control options of any app I've seen (for iso, shutter speed, white balance, focus, etc.). I Really like how precise I can make the shutter speed and that I can change the noise reduction levels. I do wish when shooting in RAW while zoomed in that it would save the crop though. And an automatic stacking mode (like Pixel's astrophotography mode) would make this app just perfect.","Finally an app which works great not just in terms of quality, the UX is really much more user friendly than most of all the other photo apps, mostly providing these awkward menus.

In terms of ease of use, effects and options it is much better than what you can find on pcs. Only downside is clarity of output which may be due to - 1. Croppin reduces output quality. Better crop using another software first. 2. Limit 720. Therefore stronger compression will apply if your file is 720+ 3. Actual processing is decent but not very sharp. Cant really expect much from a mobile software. 4. GIF itself is not a very advanced format","This is is great for editing GIFs. I screen record them and then can edit the size and exact frames I want to be seen. There are a lot more features available once you start digging into it.","Best!!!! Please, I request you to add options to in manage section: - Rotate pics - Crop pics - Bulk or select all to add/edit to delete pics. - 1080 quality, if possible.

I purchased it to be able to record video so I can setup my phone on a raised tripod and have the ability to start/stop the video while also keeping an eye on what is recording without needing to reach the phone itself. I haven't used it for photos so I can't comment much on that other than to say that the couple of test photos I took seemed to be fine. There are two important features that are missing that prevent a 5 star review. First, I was really wanting the ability to pause video recording and re-start instead of having to stop and re-start a new video thus creating a new file. I am filming sporting events with lots of dead time and this is a critical feature. Second, I couldn't find anywhere to change the storage location of the videos so they can be stored on my phone's SD card instead of its internal storage. Other than that, the app seems to do what it claims and I haven't had any issues with connectivity.","I have reached out for a refund or a repair, but nothing. BUYER BEWARE! I used this app to take videos with my phone on a tripod, of my kids ballet recital that my husband was missing due to deployment, while wrangling a 2 year old. I really though \"man! This app has been a lifesaver!\", until I went onto my phone afterwards and all of the videos/pictures were greyed out and said \"failed to play video, and unknown error has occured\" when I tried to play them. I can't recover the sentiment or time","I recently purchased the camera pro app. I have a Samsung galaxy gear watch & galaxy S10+.  With the new update the app will record 30 secs of video. The app closes suddenly. There was a \"error #3\" that popped up on the screen.  On playback of the vid, it recorded for 30 seconds and keeps a frozen image making the vid 60 secs long.  Which is an improvement from the 10 second videos prior to this latest update. I really need the video recording to function for at minimum of 7 minutes.","This app is exceptional, However; it has one major flaw that literally ruins the entire experience. IT DOESN'T RECORD AUDIO HOW DO I SPEND 2 DOLLARS ON A CAMERA CONTROL APP THAT RECORDS VIDEO WITH NO AUDIO??????? Very sloppy, be careful about purchasing.

Video conversion is a surprising addition, but I'd prefer a lot more still image options and more focus on image filters and effects in general over the little-used video element.","[EDIT] Nice & Excellent APP. Still one of the best of Cartoon Photo Apps. What makes it great, it supports both still image cartoon maker and live video cartoon maker that fun to play with. Pretty good job! I bought the full ad-free version on 2016, and still satisfied by far without any problem, even after Android upgrades. • May the only drawback is it has no built-in image/video browser. 5★ if it does exist. [EDIT] • Many similar Apps out there. But this may the best one. Thank you, Dev! 🍷😊","Simple interface and simple to use. Results are great. Thumbs up to the developer.","Very nice. Three reasons for buying: 1) it's really good, 2) you can BUY it (=> it doesn't have ads), 3) it doesn't ask for yearly subscriptions or in-app purchases. Too many apps fail the last two tests! Nice job by developers, 5*","I had to uninstall and now its stuck on pending when trying to install it again. Please fix this. I'm paying for a service you're denying me.

This dev must be supported in producing an outstanding piece of professional near SLR quality photographic software. 5 stars isn't enough! I haven't had a chance to push this excellent app to its limits but there's time yet. I doubt it will work well on every single phone or tablet with a camera out there. Or that it will give great results from a poor quality phone. But so far so good. All I can say is if your phone has a half decent camera your pictures will turn out great!","This app is great. I use it the most for timelapse and i have to admin that no boredom has given me photos that are so well balanced that they have a smooth transition from day to night. Flicking is kept to minimum. I'm thrilled. For night shots, I usally use a combination of 2 seconds of exposure with shooting every 5 seconds, but when it's dusk and there more people, a combination of 1 second of exposure every 3 seconds suits me better. It would be good if those 3 seconds were allowed.","Great app, which I needed for the custom aspect ratio option. Unfortunately that seems to be entirely broken. See my bug report which I emailed to you. btw on my tab s2 the image in the viewfinder is stretched out like a piece of rubber . This app is nowhere near thebstage of asking money for it. In 2021 it is still broken. Bah. More elaborate bug report: it works for 4:6 but if I enter 40:60, then the app changes the ratio back to 40:42 for some reason. Also the thumbnail is not cropped","This thing is very unstable. On many occasions, it crashes as soon as you start it. In some rare cases, it ends up forcing you to reboot the phone. Things like the zoom slider in manual focus work... once. Then, bye-bye until you restart the program. If it weren't for this plethora of bugs, it wouldn't be a bad program.","Not working on my s20 ultra... I was excited about many controls but all the exciting ones are disabled, the slow-mo (1080p) maxes out at 160fps and/or crashes the camera. This app is needlessly over complicated and the photos it takes are nowhere near as good as the ones taken on the native app. Needless to say that because it's so limited on controls and options it makes for a worse app than the native camera app on my phone. Sorry but it's true, I tested it for a few hours..."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.riseupgames.proshot2","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riseupgames.proshot2&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Camera FV-5","description":"Camera FV-5 is a professional camera application for mobile devices, that puts DSLR-like manual controls in your fingertips.

The reason I give 4 stars is. I've got 3 different phones, on 2 of them (Samsung, Xiaomi) it works perfectly but on my Huawei P30pro it isn't. Every time I try to manually adjust white balance, the screen turns green, doesn't matter what I'm doing it stays green. On auto mode works normally. So I simply cannot use manual mode, which is rather annoying. By the way, i bought the pro version.","Really wanted to like this app. It is almost awesome but has very frustrating flaws. Crashes frequently. Locking function for white balance and metering mode does nothing. Lots of manual settings revert to default on every new start of the app, having to set all my favorite settings over and over again. (Edited to remove some user error based criticism and add stars, sorry for that part!) Please fix these things, you're so close!","Dropped to 3 stars, and moved review I did here over to lite version. Paid for version advertised more resolutions, got same after paying for pro, and no response from author as of yet. Will change review if author contacts me with reasonable fix. Pro also has no setting above 12mp , which is sad when newer cameras go as high as 48mp","Please make the ISO,Aperture,Shutter,WB settings stay as they were configured, like on analog camera. The previous versions did this, this new version starts every session anew. This was the selling point for me. Otherwise this is a perfect app if one prefers manual DSLR analog way of taking photos!","Love it. Don't know why people are complaining. Dramatically has improved my oneplus 8 pros pictures. My stock camera app was ok, the pro version of that was better, but this app is way better then pro version. It's actually made my one plus a competitor on the flagships of Samsung and google."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.flavionet.android.camera.pro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flavionet.android.camera.pro&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Litchi for DJI Mavic / Phantom / Inspire / Spark","description":"Unlock the full potential of your DJI Mavic/Phantom/Inspire/Spark with Litchi, the #1 app for DJI drones\r\n\r\nWith over 4000 successful daily flights, Litchi is the most trusted autonomous flight app for your DJI drone\r\n\r\nCompatible with DJI Mavic Mini 1, Mavic 2 Zoom/Pro, Mavic Air/Pro, Phantom 4 Normal/Advanced/Pro/ProV2, Phantom 3 Standard/4K/Advanced/Professional, Inspire 1 X3/Z3/Pro/RAW, Inspire 2, Spark  \r\n\r\nPurchase Litchi today and get a 30% off coupon towards your Airdata.com subscription, exclusive to Litchi pilots, refer to https://flylitchi.com/airdata for more info\r\n\r\nFeature highlights:\r\n\r\n• Waypoint mode (support for Mavic Mini 1 coming soon)\r\nWhether you are a professional or beginner, Litchi offers the most intuitive yet powerful waypoint mission engine.

However, I should not have relied on this app for important work-related files or use it with large quantities of files, due to the lack of separation of Favorites into a new folder, and the glitchiness of the app in general. Created much more work for me when I purchased it to make life easier...","I do use it quite frequently to store my media on my phone. Especially now that most modern phone don't support microsd, it's a great tool to have to back up and store on the go. One thing it's lacking is a good media support and maybe a support for comic books format .cbz? You can play MP4 but that's about it you need to use VLC to open MKV or other software that you have installed. That'll be nice","When opening a picture folder, the grid of pictures keeps refreshing, with pictures changing position until the full list loads. If you have like 1000 pictures, it takes like a minute where you cannot use the app. Than you press back and again wait a minute. Also I would like to be able to adjust the grid size and have a favorite button. As a photographer this would be super useful for selecting the best picture.","My Google Pixel 3a phone (OS = Android 11) wouldn't read any exFAT formatted microSD cards that I connected via a USB C card reader. Both Google's file browser and several other 3rd party file browser apps I tried wouldn't read them. Google's default file browser and connected devices (under system settings) detected all of the cards I tried, but invariably indicated an error reading them followed by a prompt to format, which would obviously erase all files stored on any given card. The cards all tested fine on my laptop and when I hooked up the same microSD to USB C adapter to a Samsung phone it read all my microSD cards with no issues. After a bit of online searching, I finally found an explanation as to why my Google Pixel 3a phone wouldn't read the cards via my USB C card reader. Apparently, some phones (especially budget ones that lack a microSD slot) don't natively support Microsoft's exFAT format on account the phones' manufactures opted to forgo Microsoft's exFAT licensing fees as a means to cut costs. This app gives my phone that functionality. Now when I attach my USB C card reader device, it reads exFAT formatted microSD cards just fine and I can transfer files to my phone's internal storage. In my case, I'm collecting camera footage of wildlife shot by motion-activated cameras. I'm out in the field in a remote area that's out of cell phone range, I and don't want to lug a laptop around with me. I'm giving the app four stars for now, as this app is working as I hoped it would. I may revise my score up or down accordingly after I've had more time to evaulute the app.","Only found two folders worth of media on my USB HD, there's three more on there.

Urgent requirement for a bug fix to how this app affects Chrome. Address bar doesn't hide and when switching between tabs I can only see a list instead of preview pane. Please address these issues and issue an update as soon as possible or expect me to request a refund.","On S21 Ultra it works well most of the time. For some reason it stops working occasionally while appearing to take photos but really isn't. Restarting the phone solves the issue. Get that fixed, then an easy 5 out of 5 stars.","Extremely annoying that after paying for the app, I then had to make another payment before I could use it. I think it was the interval setting, can't remember. Otherwise the app seems to work well, but longer evaluation needed. Unfortunately, it also interferes with Google Chrome. Usually Chrome allows me to see all my tabs as a visual display. With this app installed they appear as a list of links, and the back button doesn't work. This meant I had to uninstall the app, which I'd already paid","Can't get it to work at all...press configure to move the red icon over the shutter button and no red icon appears for me to move..the red icon just flies off to the right of the screen..so I set timers etc pressed started..looked like it was taking photos I guess..I'm not sure the counter on the intervalometer was working but the camera itself wasn't showing any signs of taking pics..anyway when it finishes there was no photos anywhere on my phone..","Now working. Changed review from 1 star to 5. Tried setting interval time more than exposure time it worked. If u want images with 8 seconds exposure then set 8 seconds exposure in camera app and set 9 (or more) second interval in Intervalometer. It works. It captures images with 8 second exposure and wait for 1 second (9-8) for next image.

Mask a portion with this tool and that portion of the foreground image will become transparent and reveal the background.","summary":"Superimpose one photo on top of another using the original Superimpose app!","installs":"100,000+","minInstalls":100000,"maxInstalls":130120,"score":3.7302632,"scoreText":"3.7","ratings":3035,"reviews":1333,"histogram":{"1":648,"2":169,"3":219,"4":309,"5":1687},"price":0.99,"free":false,"currency":"USD","priceText":"$0.99","offersIAP":false,"size":"3.8M","androidVersion":"4.1","androidVersionText":"4.1 and up","developer":"Pankaj Goswami","developerId":"Pankaj+Goswami","developerEmail":"pankaj.goswami@gmail.com","developerWebsite":"http://superimposeapp.com/","developerAddress":"Pixel Fry\nRegus CBD.\nL-9 Raheja Towers (East Wind)\nBangalore, 560001, India","privacyPolicy":"http://www.superimposeapp.com/privacy.html","developerInternalID":"6423462666994635244","genre":"Photography","genreId":"PHOTOGRAPHY","icon":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/FdZ9FQwJ7lD53faJ1YZ0Qfbl_nMXOuDFTJ25cWkBJBHCYvzZfoSdr-Tplcf6_IHSqJwS","headerImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/HNdNQChOEb3LuZIPLnpPkawq1H8PW2coAHaGHD1UddlPpCsE6dF9Rjj--4gvRBFyiUA","screenshots":["https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/w9qEzSOLe5ENPdzScjgKlm-8MFgQc6wn1chedqEXTkPP4zrhIvv5hC4Cbhy3sehTA5k","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/F5SVyXEFLHzshrOq5f6rPAIy_kvkOlrtZOeZyCznv3f8RTxiM7fcJ25MHDbocarKLjo","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/N5lbVJiJiF8gkWaQYEiUzyAFb_-vozTwtUIHxktBKvgwFnLrZN5JlyCgiZoG1dJQ6IE","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/Vh54ODkXjiT12MmT0T8CuQykKTF4_lZ0-WpXcclsGtHHl6CFWrZlfbksdenY-G0Fn6w","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5JkwFU97xIw2UwyMqMZiKDtl6unzsLgbh_G_wvDonMfXB_I9UMsquQMFOej4FeFQoR77","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/PEj3_mFmOsKKVtHiVPBqekRSx3MZJSJsUiOsaAxjO4S1xis1Kmi-N2LeYIVFO9mOPw","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/2CHbN3TBWjKAGapEABpsKDmYGWUJjgaGuenDrZUTZ_O0U38m52qgGWfBery4-ahsTOjP","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/mXKIsOY5l-g64WdSzo-mx_J5feR3zM_wgbaj60GXukRniS5Mcr03KASAHc1-zn_KkdWk","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/f8rzuArCGn3tq7aaNVMyxJDAuGqlF7CXy6TEXs-fnHNV5-sXCNludXI-coXYuaAxLu_W","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/p5ZSrVBreHJ-sHTUc4MfXEgtebWedP47-W917d56cD6iLPUcNvPj6W1UNjR-6gTDHjY","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/d3Lu35oRXnrB_7rYT1acUg04q5yFnEKi-wHsnBMfPNc1bdORXRuRu2I-ILzKtlYHEdc","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/fNld3xnBEJm058EhHUOO_f3I-8FqZDua_hmMNIlSfVg1aaxUHpyr3t_zfBSm6L_VqRE","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/MZYfV6duFL9a73wIfDPSyrb4ZT9I74LY2MvdkVpmK-YQkq4xyvrjDSO49xKtihAAEqk","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/B-P3lahzHEkbMUZDNul_qoBMrDvadDXkQdE4dBT18EXfU2aJ1rLD3elosdvWuwpBI4M","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/XQHmeY4GE6SgAqGXoyJkSsQGUXQBW9tWsmYOrfD6VHi4T-O01zjPfzJXz8RB5B1U404","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rZLmQn8seqI6djVS0y4xFcBNwYQlxLrbTQ8EoXK-6mDuHE039OvxaCmBlSgxwVRT4ak","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/4ftq-cxTa9VLTA7Vj66ICVMXnxvbjAW_ls7DtE2Mlcm-56XbxwrCtavv7c9NePZe6zA","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/HIMv996U1vG6MQ8h47r1TCX2FViyerN5-IX3KG7DkSdSKUuOSMMHA5tHZzp8hn24afM","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9X8cXPykTcINkCQzMoOzMHdZ5h__Hm2FRvx8y_m3iPU-3IbiX4I6USTxSsvwPQJq1uk","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/aerh3KLnARvsKFkRrWQlT81MuxwrtK1SiZGhPNo4fKstyQGU40pVNcflXYS-npYGUQ","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/MWLxZS9Xl0G9lZ9ZyTVCf4gOR7YqTmUikAYDati3P0x2mbRsUOh3zHsh83TxXp03K4E","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0T5e0fpwbOHaVMGjwngkkJWd-el9sDeJl1XbOLtM090_Rz2-vA50cC0guEV5CLXgeg","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/CV1JDPGYr8GJNrysd04RAz-1MMYjCwuZR6q878rqMMSMTsuzQM-X8dm3DlKoe1ma0ctK","https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/xwP7hQbrRkKQh4UQnvcfETUEenSOob1mMQnQqqB7wyb9c_SZhntERCmMc2wos5l4-3w"],"video":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PPFvuIKHrR4?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0","videoImage":"https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/HNdNQChOEb3LuZIPLnpPkawq1H8PW2coAHaGHD1UddlPpCsE6dF9Rjj--4gvRBFyiUA","contentRating":"Everyone","adSupported":false,"released":"Apr 24, 2014","updated":1549872305000,"version":"6.1.5","recentChanges":"Bug fixes and improvement.<br><br>If you like using Superimpose, please rate or review us on the Play Store.

I hope the Android version catches up to the iOS one, and that you launch Superimpose X here soon.","Been using this for years and love it's interface, no my note 10+ I experience a few crashes but understand the process that makes it happen so I don't do it. But for years this app has been my go to for cutting out athletes more precise than any other mobile app I've tried.","I'm overall pretty happy with the app, but the Android version NEEDS to catch up to the iOS equivalent because there are a lot of features we're missing out on. There is also a bug that causes the foreground to become black each time I open the filter menu or the use the \"replace but keep mask\" function, which prevents me from lowering saturation, as well as keep masks in place. It's a really bad bug.","I love it! For any of you who gives bad ratings, maybe it's because you don't know how to use this app until you make a great edit. I made a lot of edits that are really good, it just depends on how simple or complex you put your edit together. Also, maybe you can put the features from iOS version to Android version too, that would be great","i just switched from iPhone to a note 9 & used to use this app (superimpose x) on my iPhone and it was by FAR the best photo editing app I've ever used. However, it's a major disappointment on an Android phone. most features aren't there and is very limited. please bring this up to the same standard as was on the iPhone!"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.superimposeapp.superimposeapp","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.superimposeapp.superimposeapp&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"PhotoSync Bundle Add-On","description":"This product is the ‘PhotoSync Bundle Add-On’ Activation License of PhotoSync.

If you want some pretty trippy vaporwave style photo manipulation direct from your phone, look no further. The team behind this really knew what they were doing!! A definite winner.","I used this app quite a lot at some stage upon downloading which I adore and had zero problems, I then took a little break but kept the app up to date, as of now, 14th July 2021 my app refuses to let me do anything, it takes me to the main app, choosing any of the categories opens my photos, but choosing a photo does absolutely nothing, if I then choose camera and take a photo, the app stops and closes itself, of course its still a 5* because I know the app is fantastic, this is just a small bug","Love the pro version of this, the original version for this app was giving me a hard time so i though why not and just bought the pro version because i like the filters. My only problem with this app is their not being enough customisation options, other than that its all good. just needs some updates here and there.","Absolutely worth the money. I really enjoy using this to make gifs and edit pictures. This is the first photo editor that hasn't ceased to amaze me. Big ups to the devs who made this. 👍","I love this app, so I paid for the pro version. The only problem is that it doesn't let me save my edited videos?

UI elements overlap, tons of wasted space, icons right on the screen edges etc. Also there's a rare bug that prevents the icon bar from being displayed again. Going in and out of Settings seems to correct it though. Also no love for landscape mode. All in all a great effort that I support with my money. Very functional as-is.","I'm really glad this app exists, because it provides functionality (like locking the temperature scale) not provided by the official Flir app. But the app is unpolished and buggy: There are glitches in choosing the color pallette, UI elements overlap on my Pixel 3a, and I often have to swipe the app out of my rscents to get the normal camera working again. I'll use it a lot, but wish it was better.","IMHO, I found this app to be only a partial step above the free version. I also feel that the 1st gen devices are better for more defined and robust pic quality for the end user experience VS the gen 2 devices. The USB-C port on the 2nd gen device is an excellent upgrade vs the 1st gen USB mini port. FLIR was very generous with me.

It's always one of the first apps I put on a new phone. Today is the first it's ever disappointed me. It keeps crashing and restarting. I use this for both photography and my digital art. Not having it is really crippling to me. I discovered the app will work until I give it permission to access my gallery. The app works great on my old phone.","Everything was a 5 star ratings until this time to renew my subscription!!!!! My fee went from $10.00 's a year to $30.00's and I spend half my time being told my pictures CANNOT be processed!!!!!! So after 3 years of NO PROBLEM 'S at $10.00's a year , to $30.00 's ayear and no processed photos of what I'm trying to achieve!!!! Beware consumers. Like I said first 3 years were fabulous. And now its disappointing and frustrating. Thank you.","I do really love this app! I've enjoyed it for some years now. The pro version is worth it, to get rid of the watermark. I would like to see more group photo frames 🙏 Thanks for your help and suggestions 😁✌️ I have an update This app is telling me ' it can verify and I need to check my internet connection and reinstall it ' Why??","Best looking filters by far than any other apps I use. I have ran 100+ photos through this app and have loved many of them. Still there are some quality of life features that would be mega helpful. Let us search filters by selecting filter types such as headshots, shoulder up shots, and the filters that do not need a picture of a person. Needs wide photo support for things like Facebook cover images Needs the ability to save masks so you don't have to edit the mask for every single picture.","★✔PROS⇨ One of the Best Imaging Apps for Android by far.

Bought this app before, but somehow unable to install it into my new phone. So i repurchased the app cause it's that good."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.shinycore.picsaypro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shinycore.picsaypro&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"SpectraCam — See invisible.

Although our devices, many of them of which, utilize IR sensors they don't offer the depth of field and resolution required for proper IR imagery. If there were a way to get this to function as a legitimate full spectrum, UV, and/or IR image sensor.. even with modifications.. I will flip the 1 to a 5","Fake, it does a pretty good job at faking it but you can instantly tell it's just faking it. For one it does not see the light coming from a remote control, 2 it doesn't see through any materials as anyone who is into the uv spectrum knows you can see through thin plastics and cotton clothes. I could not see through my wife's shirt for example lol. Garbage, refunded it right away. I suggest you do the same if you try it unless the fakeness is okay with you.","it actually works , just one thing it has no Zoom!!!! I was disappointed to find that out and read a response from developer that he thinks zoom is not necessary?????????????why would you think that","Working on OnePlus 7Pro; Does not have much range in either spectra, but it does it. I would love it if the dev would make the color coded mode able to be range controlled, or perhaps shift the spectra hot region to specify a particular light's intensity. More color pallets would be sweet too. And to top off the wishlist, a masked variant that shows the difference between either spectra and the green, then color the highlights all on one plane.","Fake!

The dev is also quite responsive. However, I rated it only 4 stars because of the omission of one feature that I feel is important. The app is rich in filter options, and there should be a way for settings to be saved. In my case, I use one of the filters (which can now be applied in varying percentages) to compensate for the fact that my stock camera produces results that are dull and undersaturated. This camera can do that perfectly, but it becomes necessary to set it up all over again manually each time I use it. Very frustrating.The previous version of this app (which lacked many other key features that this new version does have) did, at least, have that capability. Why change that one good thing about the older version in an otherwise great update?","Love this camera app. Easy controls and great photos.","Perfect camera very nice camera application 👍","Not very good. I shouldn't have bougt this. Was told it was a great app but as usual just like all of the internet all lies.","If this works for you, great!

It's pretty awesome, especially the camera view. Unfortunately there is no way to correct if the calibration is off. With several devices the sun location was noticeably off. I bought two other apps doing the same thing and both of them are accurate on my device. So it's not my phone that's bad.

Everything was good the blending, the whiteness adjustments, barely any lens corrections where needed now it's all gone to hell in a hand basket. Now when I'm rendering a photo of 21 pics the render is cut off and only a third of the top row is visible. The rest is cut off? Any ideas? I've tried different stitches different rendering settings with no resolve? I meant a cylindrical cup to each individual picture. I have it set to auto for rendering style.","I used to use this app (free) as my primary stitcher and it never let me down. Would happily update my review to the five stars it deserved but... decided to buy it today and it won't stitch a few photos of the horizon/sunset... Fails. What gives? Update: \"No panorama(s) detected\" was the error. Only issue was with those sunset photos... likely not enough overlap and too much glare/AE not locked when I took the photos. Works perfectly with every other image set. I'll chalk it up to user error","[2021] Still using this regularly to turn video pans into panorama pictures. Works well with most scenes. Too much flat sameness (sea shore) will confuse it. Even works with videos from my point and shoot camera. Original review [2019]: Happy with it so far. I was specifically looking for a video to panorama tool. Videos taken from one spot with a pivot motion seem to work well. Videos created by moving the camera like a dolly shot in a movie not as so nicely. I hope to test this out more soon."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.facebook.rethinkvision.Bimostitch.pro","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.rethinkvision.Bimostitch.pro&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Long Exposure Camera - Motion Camera","description":"Motion camera is a camera app made for shooting long exposure shots easily without worrying the photos being overexposed during daytime.

screen when doing LR Time Lapse Photography. I had full screen twice and back to the normal screen. But that was accidental. Paul Ventress comment about not getting video was helpful because being curious, I discovered how to record video. First tap on the QDSLR live view icon. That makes the RED video recording icon appear. On my Nikon Z6, I flipped the camera switch to video and recorded a 30-second video which played back without any problem.","Works with note9 d5300 wifi. This app does exactly what you pay for!

The list of compatible cameras is there * This does NOT replace the free app from Nikon that let you record with live view. I know what you trying to record you pervs * This app cannot crash your camera. Dropping it will. Good day","Excellent app, written by a brilliant dev, highly recommend. (I wish the folks at Sony would work with him and make their devices compatible with USB to save some battery life for overnight time-lapses. For now only wifi control is supported on Sony cameras.) I've used the app to control several Nikon cameras before and a Canon, always with great satisfaction. Just Sony won't let connect via USB. (To me it seems that Sony is just not good at writing software and are missing the point on anything else than hardware, even the firmware are so so on my ILCE 7m3)","Doesn't support video recording as stated in the features. This was the main reason for buying this app so quite disappointed.

Just make sure to avoid any colors. Point the camera towards that surface and click the Analyze button. The app will then show the measured color temperature of the light that falls on that surface. The app will also recommend a white balance setting for you to use on your camera in these lighting conditions.\r\n\r\nWhat is Color Temperature?\r\nColor temperature is a characteristic of visible light that measures the hue of light from a light source. Color temperatures are usually measured in Kelvin (K). Low color temperatures (below 3000 K) are called warm colors (red and yellowish white) while high color temperatures (above 5000 K) are called cool colors (blueish white). Technically the color temperature is the temperature of an ideal black-body radiator that radiates light of comparable hue to that of the light source.\r\n\r\nWhen is Color Temperature Important?\r\nColor temperatures are of special interest in all kinds of color photography. The human eye easily compensates for the color temperature of different light sources. Most cameras today have a feature called Automatic White Balance, AWB, which tries to do the same. In some conditions this works OK, in other conditions the results are poor. Many photographers therefore prefer to manually set the white balance value on the camera to match the color temperature of the current scene. With this application you can measure the color temperature before doing the white balance setting on you camera to get a more accurate setting.\r\n\r\nYou can also use this app to learn about the color temperatures in your environment. With this knowledge you can develop a better understanding of how the color temperatures varies which helps you when you are trying to master the light and colors in your photography.\r\n\r\nHow Accurate are the Measurements?\r\nTo measure the color temperature accurately is a complex issue. On an Android(TM) device is it complicated further by the fact that all devices are slightly different from each other.

I set the camera to that and everything was red.","Doesnt work on my Pixel 3. Says this is designed for older phones... I think if the developer updates this .. this will be a home run because a lot of rookies are buying cameras these days... I wish this app existed when I was starting out.","It works, but there is a major flaw. It's a simple un-fussy app to analyse the colour temperature of lighting. If you want to know the colour temperature of a bulb so you can match it, it can be ideal but there is a problem. Sadly, it is woefully inaccurate when used with LED lighting. This is caused by the LED mains flicker interacting with the scanning of the phone's camera. This causes moire fringing in the sampling area, leading to erratic results. A better sampling model is required.","This Color Temperature app worked incredibly well on my Galaxy S1. I installed it on later Galaxy S phones & had poor results. Lucky for me I kept my old S1 phone and I still use the app on the S1 and it works so well. It seems that the smartphone manufacturers have altered the lens glass on newer phones and the app just doesn't respond as accurately. In my opinion the app itself is superb. I believe the smartphone lens is the problem, possibly making people think the app is not accurate.","Not perfect, but close enough. I bought this to measure white balance on a scene with mixed lighting. I have some studio lights and know their exact color temperatures. On my Galaxy S10+, the measurements are within a reasonable margin of error for all of them. It does seems to read the daylight temps a bit more accurately, however.

Needs an indicator to show which task you're working on.","This is the most comprehensive and most versatile photography planning mobile app I have found. The UI can be quite intimidating at first, but once figured out (with the help of the very informative and well-made video tutorials and user manuals prepared by the developer himself), you will come to appreciate why it was designed that way. Features such as “Sun/Moon Finder” and “Milky Way Seeker” simply have no rival among all photography planning apps. The VR view finder is amazing and works differently than the AR view found in other apps such as Sun Surveyor and PhotoPills. VR view allows you to visualize the composition with the focal length of your choice with great precision without having to be present at the planned location. The developer tried to fit many things on the screen and sometimes it can be challenging to access certain items on the screen with your finger, but since my device is a Galaxy Note 8, the S-Pen works very well with the app. The app is actively developed and you can expect very regular updates.","I've used this app on quite a few occasions, particularly for visualizing moonrise over the foothills where I live.

Firstly, image stabilization is very weak, and after some time stopped working at all. In Samsung app frame crop is used but stabilization is perfect. It will be great to have ability to change stabilization intensity. Secondary, turning on the flash causes app crash. Also, while filming in dark places I can see many details, but on result video most of them turns black. Noise reduction is very aggressive. I would like to turn it off.","Ok, back for another attempt on another device. Seems better now. Only issues are I wish it locked settings so when you return to app, last setting are set. Startup is slow so I'd miss shots everytime. Also needs a return back to camera button. Gave another star. Almost perfect. 06/01/21. Cool app but the continuous focus is anjoying.","I got this app as I am new and it was rated very high. I have the new Galaxy S21 and the first time I try to record it gives me a critical camera error. Then freezes up won't do anything. So for a first impression this is horrible app. I see that some have had great success with it but I'm just being straight up honest. Better luck next time. I'd like my money back.","Looks like the picture on the box. Video camera capable of recording in 1080p up to 4K if your camera is capable of doing so.

Now I get all of effects & filters. 😀 this was worth it. Thanks for this app!","In short, this is by far one of THE BEST photo editing apps! Mostly because of all the different kind of filters and photo effects that you normally can't find on other apps. This app has hundreds of filters and effects and most of the effects have different ways to change and edit those effects. You can also change your existing photos and videos already stored in your gallery as well as create and edit new ones as well! The big thing with this app is the WIDE VARIETY of different kind of effects and filters. I HIGHLY SUGGEST downloading this app as it is considerably far more superior than most all the other apps that claim to have all these photo effects when really they're all just the same as all the others....","The main reason why I bought MPPro was because to get the full feature and better experience. The feature on the android is not as good as on iOS, and also some feature didn't work properly. This app needs updates. I need the developer to get back here and fix this app. Please. I can finally say, did not worth your money. Thank you. I'll edit my review after fixing your app.","Many camera apps lack sufficient manual controls and present the user with too many gimmicky filters. This app does that too! In fact, it lacks almost any practical control over your photos at all, offers vastly more silly filters than most apps, and the filters it offers are far sillier and far less useful.

Supports custom ratios and sizes in pixels. You can add custom watermarks to photos. UI is not the most intuitive, but users will figure it out.

Just like when you're using LR and PS for the 1st time too. Another MYR12.99 well spent. This will permanently replace the LR mobile app on my phone! Thanks devs!","Takes a bit of getting used to just swiping across the screen to adjust the settings instead of using a slider, but once you've made the change there's no going back. Fiendishly clever but quirky AI editor, with a simple, clean interface containing tons of advanced tools and options. Great fun to use!","LOVE IT! I am getting back into art/design and digital marketing and have been testing different apps (outside of Adobe). I was just using Handy Photo for the 1st time - working on a personal project - and I absolutely love it! The UI is fantastic and the tools are great - easy enough for beginners and customizable settings for more advanced users. I've only used it for a couple hours but so far no issues. From what I've seen so far I definitely recommend!! Yippee. 🤘🏻","I'm a visual/Hands on learner so I get one minute into the tutorial and I'm impatient to test the product out. When I started to play with all of the buttons and controls I was amazed by the depth of detail and infinite layers that could be used then modified and then further modified. I have come to realize just how essential HP is to my satisfaction in my art and photos. I am so appreciative of your app. Can't wait to see what's going to blossom with Handy Photo on my next project. Thanks😘","Could be a good app, Devs dont seem to care that the app crashes and triggers the maintenance app daily. This type of buggy app is not acceptable if you are paying for the privilege to own it, yet the devs dont have the ability to solve issues, most of these reviews left are from clueless owners who dont know that the app is causing issues on their devices yet. I hope it gets turned around and worked out.

I don't know why, it's fine when I try to choose an image from my panasonic or Canon camera, but it suddenly crash specifically with my sony a6400. Is it because the file size? I don't think so, because many of my friends uses more larger sensor, and they're fine.. so kinda need your help here.. I'm sure you'll fix it Thanks","After installing for week it's work fine. After its crashes all time I'm using Oneplus Nord on android 11. Please fix this problem as soon as possible.","I have updated my Android version, but now, when I want to apply Phoyo Summary to one of my photo, the apps closed unexpectedly. I don't feel this kind of crash when I used previous Android version","This a great app to use for social media but the Android version leaves a lot to be desired. Coming from there website I saw a great looking modern professional product. On the Android version however the text and spacing is very blocky and thrown together and not anything I'd want to use on social media. These versions of these apps are so wildly different from each other. I would like to see some love on the Android app so I can update this review and recommend this app to all my friends!","Over all the app does what it's supposed too. Se features that I wish you could add, depending on how hard it may be. 1. Resizing the info. (Comes out way to big) 2. Making the background image have a black slider. (To make the words pop out just a bit more) My website is too long so the words get placed underneath, when resizing. Allowing the words to re-adjust to one line. Other than that I like great work guys. Hopefully you all add some future updates.

It would be the perfect app if it can utilize fully the sensor of the phone. It's miles better than the stock camera app (video quality wise). I'll update my rating if this is implemented (really no other complain aside from what I stated).","10 bit video from my S20 Ultra (Snapdragon) looks phenomenal. I wish I could also record 10 bit log but that's limited to 8 bit on my phone and 10 bit 60fps is a no-go. I assume those are hardware limitations but I'm happy to be wrong if those can be fixed. In the meantime, the quality of 10 bit 24fps is far above anything the native app can produce (even in pro mode) so it was well worth the purchase just for that. There is a learning curve but it wasn't as steep as some others have suggested. It took a couple of hours to test all the different settings to see what works but after that was pretty easy.","Every parameter can be tailored and the phone hardware can be used at its best. After a random time, however, the picture can turn very dark (unusable) and the only solution is to stop filming and start a new take.","Waiting so much to try this amazing app, with zero doubts is the best professional video camera app for android, hopefully the 10 bits recording option will be available for pixel 4xl, and will be incredible","I must admit that i wrong inpatient when it comes to downloading from the internet or Google play..

I do recommend this great app to every mobile phone user, mobile filmmaker or mobile photographer.."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"lv.mcprotector.mcpro24fps","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lv.mcprotector.mcpro24fps&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"PhotoSync Cloud Add-On","description":"This product is the ‘PhotoSync Cloud Add-On’ Activation License of PhotoSync.

For some reason I'm a developer has at least four different versions of the same functionality. EXIF Pro, Photo EXIF Editor Pro, what's the difference? Why would you take the same functionality and put out different copies of it as if they were competitors?","It is a good app and for most users ok. It looses a points because I can't change the date / time independently. For me I wanted to use it to correct the date and time of my action camera when the dates are wrong. Most of the time the times are correct and I want to just shift the dates rather than change them . For me this would be a 5 star with this feature and also solve many people's problems.","Super fast support! I had an issue today with the new version, made a report and got immediate response. And few hours later the problem is solved. Kudos to the developers!!! BTW this tool is extremely helpful when you use several editing apps, which often don't work correctly with the tags. With this tool you can fix this with few clicks!","Great app. I love using a camera but not having GPS is disappointing. Google does a decent job of estimating based on location data, but I can. Use this app to add GPS info to my camera stills. It's a little clunky and takes a little getting used to and some patience. But I love it. I do wish it could pull Google's location data to make preliminary estimates but don't mind doing it and fine tuning it myself.","'Photo Exif Editor is reporting troubles with Google Play services' is being reported when calling the Photo Map function. What has this service to do with this function that makes it fail when not available? How is this to be resolved?

It has made processing prints so much easier as I no longer have to count seconds. At first, I was worried that the red light mode would still fog my paper. But as long as I turn my phone's display lighting down, there is no problem. I just have to press the red light mode button for each print I process. And I like the metronome sound counting down the seconds as it keeps me alert. Thank you for this app!","Revolutionary! Been looking for something like this as it's sometimes tough to keep a hold of agitation times and in general organise the process. I've gone from writing down in a notebook the exact minute and second I need to start and stop agitating to just having the app telling me exactly what to do with the timer and countdown feature. Stress free development.","Overall excellent app in terms of customization, bit currently suffers from a few stability issues on my Galaxy S7. Two requests that I would ask to be implemented are the ability to set the app to default to safelight mode right off the bat at all times (it goes back to white light mode whenever I reset the timer which I find annoying) and the ability to time multiple prints since I generally would like to move onto another print while a previous print is final washing. As long as you work around those issues, it's really a great app and it's made my workflow in the darkroom much simpler.","Great app for film developing but for darkroom printing the safelight mode doesn't stay on when resetting the process to start a new print"],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.digitaltruth.dlt","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digitaltruth.dlt&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"Add Watermark","description":"Add watermarks to your pictures.

Great slideshow options, with random shuffle and different transition options. OneDrive app itself has lacked good photo display features, but this app takes care of those needs. I don't usually purchase an app without being able to use it with a free trial, but the reviews were favorable and I took the chance. Glad I did! For just over four bucks (with tax), it is well worth the cost.","The first app that opens my Camera Roll folder with 5000+ photos and supports Google Chromecast. UI is not the prettiest but this feature is worth the the premium after Chromecast support was dropped out of the mobile apps for OneDrive in 2019. Shame Microsoft doesn't support it out of the box but kudos to the developer of this app. Gallery appears to be much faster than on the native app as well. 5* Note: As per 12/5/21 OneDrive native app has Chromecast support so make your own choice.","This is the best OneDrive photo gallery on playstore 👍🏻","If you are looking for a Google Photos alternative this is it. It has many targets, I used OneDrive. Load all photos into OneDrive, sync it with the app. Refreshes well. No hangs. I checked the firewall etc and there is no funny business. I use the PhotoSync mobile app and control all of the uploads separately into OneDrive and SkyFolio reads them like a charm. Here is a tip: If you want to edit a photo, you click on the export command back to your gallery. Nice! Thanks 👍👍👍👍👍","This App is just fantastic - especially now that it connects to OneDrive Business. We have in excess of 80,000 photos in about 100 folders and having the name of the folder added to the bottom of every Photo is fantastic. The features that come with this App - and the quick loading - make it by far the best (and cost effective) Photo and slideshow App by far on Google Play. Keep up the good work Brian - and thanks for the quick replies to help me through my fix. PS If you are twiddling your thumbs and want some more programming to do, A box and dark back ground around the folder title at the bottom of each photo would help with easier viewing of the title. :) :) Cheers and thanks again."],"editorsChoice":false,"appId":"com.snapwood.skyfolio","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snapwood.skyfolio&hl=en&gl=us"},{"title":"iWatermark+ Watermark Photos & Video With Logo etc","description":"Watermark to protect your photo and video (1080 & 4k). iWatermark+ the Essential Professional Watermark App. Batch Watermarking Using Visible & Invisible Watermarks\r\n🚫 No Ads\r\n🚫 No In App Purchases\r\n\r\nText, Logo, QR-Code, Signature on photo or video and more.

They've been in regular contact with beta fixes, but thiscapp simply doesn't work for the Note 9 and other platforms at latest Android releases. The app appears to be using some code that either Android no longer supports or that Android developers know has been broken for some time. It may be up to Plum Amazing to redesign the app using different calls in order to become upward-compatible.

I've had it for about that long. The app crashes when changing aspect ratio. If one decides a pic looks better in another position, one has to delete and choose again, instead of just dragging and dropping. No menu for options or even a tutorial at this stage is a loss, because otherwise the program works fine. May have to change this app for another, but this version doesn't have ads.","This app does exactly what I need without being so complicated that I can't understand. All I wanted was to be able to take two pictures and make them into one. I didn't think to look at collage apps. The only thing I haven't figured out is how to save the new one I made. Thanks for making an app that even a senior citizen can figure it out (mostly. - just tell me how to save)","I am disappointed that I bought the app for android. There are way fewer options than on iOS. It also crashes a lot and that causes me to start over.","Edit - after the 8/1/19 update I still cannot take pics within the app. I have used this app for 2.5 years and it always worked well. However they did an update and I can no longer save pictures I take in app. It will let me take a picture but as soon as I hit \"ok\" it takes be back to the homescreen. I've deleted and reinstalled the app twice and the issue persists. This makes this app worthless to me as that is 95% of what I do and I can do the other 5% on a different app. Please fix.","Pros-variety of backgrounds, ability to widen/narrow borders and rounded corners Cons-frequently closes and work is lost (multiple times within a few minutes). I do multiple images & sizes in collages, choices of collage collection options are limited, often have to rework images to fit. Each time you change the aspect your work is gone & have to start over.
